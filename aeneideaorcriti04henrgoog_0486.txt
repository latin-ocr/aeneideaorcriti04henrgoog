say the cotuh-word, between the two books, the oonolnsion ol
the one bringing us to· and leaving us at the port so oalled, the
oommenoement nithe other plaeing before our eyes the oiroum-
stanoes whioh caused the port to be so oalled. Nothing ean he
more smooth, easy, and natural than the transition. Never did
geography, history, and etymology, more harmoniously oombine
to draw a virid and at the same time sweet aud touohing pio-
ture Nor was poesy absent, for no lines ruthe Aeneid are more
musioal than those whioh so swee tly prolude to the moonlight
sail along the Cireaean shore.

Exaot tly parallel to, and highly eluoidatery of, the passage
before us, andt nd timprohably suggested by it, is sil. 3. 439,
where, speaking ol Pyrene, whose death¹ and buriol ιιι the
Pyrenees ransed those mountainsto be, eo oalled,„that author

says:
“tum rmrneltum mbrare reponr niet[Hro apel]
nmillaer aernmyn neontoos inerot iditaev

dfltqt rinirnot 8ιζῐοοιιιοοροοοοοί οιιιιοι,”

where there ιο prooisely the same “honos,’' and preoiselyt the
same “'nomen ’as in our text, and where, es ih our textno
less than rnt the correspondiug easos of Misenus and Palinurus
alluded to in these very verses, it ia tho επωνυμος place, not the
aetual tumulus, whioh perpetuates the nome of the deceased.
Compare also Sil. 12. 155 (ol the promontory ot Misenus,
exaotly similarly oiroumstaneed, and aetuolly referred to in
the onooun of our text):

“ neo non Misenum serr-antem Idaea sepulcro
ιιοιηὶιιο, et Herculeos videt ipsein littore Baulos,’'

where itis the'mone Misenus which preserves the name and
fame of Misenus, the person-'the sepulohro-“ sepuloro’' (per-
haps here also not to be taken too literolly), being no more than

the medium through whieh the name ol the deoeosed and'buried
person passed» to the site, the promontory Misenum

, Stena-These who with Wagner (1861) read srennnr not
only go against the authority ol· the MSS. hut against thet uui-
versnl sense whioh regards the nome as the mark ol the person,
whether living or dead, not the person es the mark of the uome;
