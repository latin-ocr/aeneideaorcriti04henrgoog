Trnnuawws.—“ ldeo quin apud Tuscos tubam constat inven-
tam‚’' Servius. “Quia tuba ab Etruscis inventa,” Wagner
(Praesti. Incorrectly, as I think, not only as tc the meaning
aad the etymology, but the fact. It was not the Tyrrheni
(Tusci, or Etrusci) who invented the trumpet, but it was the
individual Tyrrhenus, the founder ol tbe Tyrrhene colony, who
invented it and taught the world its use. From Tyrrhenus, its
inventor, the trumpet was called Tyrrhena teba, and the sound
of the trumpet Tyrrhenus chrapor, in the same way ae from
Tyrrhenus, the founder ol the colony, the colonists themselves
were called Tyrrheni. To such effect at least we have the clear
and unmistakeable statement oi Silius, 5 .10 :

“ Lydius hnic genitor, Tmoli decus, aequore longo
Maeoniam qnondam in Latias advexerat oras
T yrrlrenae pubem, dederatque aocahuhr terrie ,·
isque insueta tubae monstravit murmura primus
gentibue, et bellis ignava silentia mpit.''

If thisbe correct,.rvnnnnwns oaeneon in our text is not
elongor of Tyrrheno trumpel in the sense ol Treoua, or Etrroian
trumpet, but in the sense ot trumprt cs Tyrrhenae, or, as we
would say in English, Tyrrhenic trnmpet (Τυρσηνικης σαλπιγ-
yae, Eurip. abovei, and the additamentum ol Servius : “ Vide-
tur hic opportune Tyrrhenae ronan lacta mentio, ut iam
Tyrrhenorum castra vocare videatur Aenecs” (where Lion well
gncsses: “videatur Aeneam”) is as devoid ol foundation as it
ie devoid ol good teste.

Anna mrsu wivesu (vs. 528).-“ Nubes ita ambiebat arma,
nt ipsa in sudo effulgerent‚’' Wagner (Pereat), a gloss which,
il I understand it right, means that in the midst oi a cloud, or of
colondy sky, there was a clear space in which the armsappeared.
Not this however, bnt the very opposite, ie the meaning ol
Virgil's words. The arms appeared notin a clear space sur·
ronnded by cloud, bnt in a cloud surrounded by clear space.
The sky was periectly clear and oloudless, nothing ct all tc he
seen in it, up to the moment of the occurrence ol the prodigy.
In this perfeotly clear sky the prodigy occurs, in our author’s
words “Venus dut signum* Looking up, they see sarra
