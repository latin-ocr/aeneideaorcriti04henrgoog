their feet, resound ,· in other words, their ahiclde resonant nu'tls tac

The intention of the poet being to place prominently before the
mind ol the reader the great noise made by the army iu march,
he is not satisfied with saying scura scunnr, but adds, as an
additional subject to scusur, vunsunun runnu corrnaarra
rannus, exactly as at vs. 701, his iulebtion being to represent to
the reader the great noise made hythe swano, he is not content
to say souar Auara, but, asan additional subject to senar, adds

nr asra nouos ruisi ranna. This is another of those very
numerous instances in which Heyne has had a truer perception

oi the sense—mayI say the fine seusei-of his author, than
either of the Heinsii or Wagneisall ol whom plene scomma
'alter sonans, so as to make a separate sentence of runsuouu
runnu consessura rannus, thus rendered sslf-subserviant, and
containing its own verb consessura (est); a punctuation and
consequent interpretation for which Wagner assumes credit in
the following words ε ‘⁸ Gemma posui post sonarem melius hoe:
consanam, scincet, rannus, quam consessura sorsat rannus.
Elumbe est enim verbum eoiret adiunctum fortioris verbi parti·
cipio coarnaarm.'' The credit thus assumed by Wagner (if
indeed it be credit, and not rather discredit) belongs however
not to him, but to Daniel and Nicholas Heinsius, and the
Medioean MS, all ot which authorities divide the verse into
two at screnus. I am glad to ses that Ribbeck has returned to
the, as I doubt not, true punctuation aud structure.
eoncessum-A participle introducing a new additional
idea, subsidiery to the main idea presented in scuaur and
rursu runnu, exactly as “ indignatum,'' Georp. 2. 162, is a
new heightening idea, subserviant to the main idea expressed

in ‘⁴ stridoribns'' and “ sonat.''
