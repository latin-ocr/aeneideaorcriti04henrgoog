'l'rojan ships never fails to reeall to my reoolleotion the island
meiden Heidee (Dori Juon, oanto 2) haetening down the hill·
side towards Juan’s eave :

“ and down the oliti the island virgin came,
and near the eave with quiok, light imtetop drew‚
while the sun smiled on ber with hie first dame,
and young Aurora hesed her lips with dew,
taking hor for a sister ; ’'

the absence trom whioh picture of that splendid ornament oi
the Virgilian, the rainbow, is well compensated by “the sun
smiling on her with his first flame,'' and “Aurora kiseing her
lips with dew, taking her for a eister.'’ Pity that these happy
touohes are (with the exception of the early oantos of Doa Joow
and the early cantos oi Childe Ilarold) of but rare ooourrenoe in
Lonl Byron's numerous and, generally speaking, hastily drawn,
ill-proportioned, and unnatural sketohes.

busque ornentis;” aleo 5. 401: “ geminos immani pondero
oaestus’'; 5. 372: “vietorem Buten immani oorpore.'' The
rainbow, like the taking fire of Aoestes‘e arrow, was a bad omen.
