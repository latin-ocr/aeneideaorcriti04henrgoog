Quian-Existing in Italian at the present day, and used in the
same manner, as Metast. Temhtoole, 3. 2:
ι “ sialuminoso ilflns

del viver mio: qual moribonda faoe

scintillando s’ estingna.'’

Incurrunt 1011111 is the general enunoiatiou: 101111, tte
ersom lucrariis, the general oharaoter 011116 moon, sia, that
she is uncertain-sometimes giving very good light, as, via,
when she is at the full; sometimes bad or soanty light, via,
when sheis new or waning. The particular kind 01 light she
is giving on tho present oooasiou is fixed, by the presising terme,
11101. aurursus, she is new or waning. It is therefore the new or
waning moon, nottho oloudedmoon, whiohis spoken of. Sruvls
diminishes this soanty light, aa the traveller ie in a wood. The
remaiuder ol the description fixes the time to he night, nothing
else. For tho phrase 1161111111 rursu, eompare Georp. 1. 115 .·

[Aliter] Ilormerly thought (666 “Twelve Years' Voyage’ ')
that 1110111111 here indioatedthe general oharaoter 01 tho moon,
aa, of all moonlight. On further reflection, however, Ι have
eome to the oonolusion that it indioates only the spaoifio or
oasual oharaoter. This seems to me to be shown by its being
so prominently plaoed3 almost the very first word in this long
sentence (see Rem. on 2. 247). Our author does not say ran
1011111 lucrariis, but emphatioally rar 1100111111 rursu,
tlurtny tae uooertuiutp astho 0100011911, while tae orwrrliylrt 11
trecassinae, when 1116 moon, although aotually in the sky, is
not yet fully risen, is not yet certo, has· not yet quite put to flight
the darkness and asserted her supremaoy3 is not yet 1116 “ immi-
nens luna'' of Ηο1066(0(1.1.1.5). Ι11111111 oertns and in·
certus when applied, without explanation 01 adjunot, 10 the
sun or moon, are always used in relerenoe to this oertainty or
unoertainty 01 the light, via, that certainty or unoertaiuty
whioh depende ou the suffioient or insuffioient height 01 the
shining body above the horizon. Oompare Ovid, Met. 1. 808 .·
