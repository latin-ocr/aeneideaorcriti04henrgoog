From the great strese (aa shown by the repetition of the word
Quocuuaun)·whioh Aeneas puts upon these words, Itis plain, if

not, no matter whether there are great eities on your banks or
not, I will always be grateful to you, always honour you with

lngs.'' Observe how parallel the train of thought runs to the >

train oi thought in his thanks to Dido, I. 613:

quae ure cunque vocant terrae ; ''
