suus, These words, l know not with how munh reason, raiae. in
my mind the notion that perhaps thane is a referam in them

not merely to the dream of Heouba, via, that she waahrought

¹ to bed of a torah, but to the nameParis, rignifyinga torah. ⁴

Therefore the repetition not only in murs, but in raanan, oi
the idea already expressed in raon, ria, that οὶ a toroh, ι’. a, oi
Paris. Πυρ isfire, rapsacis a torah and Paris is exaotly rvpooc,
the vowels being omitted from saoh word. ln like manner,
πυρσος is rufus, and Ποροοι and Περσοι ara thefiroworshtbpoea
Adopting this suggestion, via, that Παρις is fax, we have either
on the one hand an explanation why Αλεέαυὸρος was so oalled,
via, from his mother's dream of her being pregnant of a torah,

¹ or, on the other hand, an explanation why Hecuba was said to
have dreamsd that she was pregnant oi a toroh, via, because the
name of the son whom she brought into the world was Paris, aa,
toret. We have also an explanation ol the fuet oi the possession
by Heouba's son Alexander ol a seeond proper name, not a
patronymie‚ a fuet oi itseli suffieiently remarkable to set one in
searoh of a reason for its existenoe.

[viliter] Heeuba is here represented not simply as sheis .

represented 10. 704, “et faee praegnans Cisseis regina Parin,''
as having brought forth Paris, but hya very bold figure she is
represented as having brought forth that whieh was the eonse-
quenee of the birth of Paris, ria, his reuss rucanas, or marriage
with Helen. The expression renas russeus is used instead of
the more usual term taedae (employed in preoisely the same
sense in the next verse but one) beoause taedae need here, so
olose upon the literal “ fax’' of Hecuba’s dream, might have led
the render into the error that the taedae of whieh Heeuba was

oonfined was the literal “ lax'’ of her dreann not the figurative
soree oi Paris⁷s marriage.

Tannus-The marriage torches, ia, marriage of Aeneas
with Lavinia, as renus lassans arethe marriage torches, sle„
marriage of Paris ¹with Helen. leemas is added to rowns,
because roras without rucanas would not express marriage3
