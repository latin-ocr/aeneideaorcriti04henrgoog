obeyed: cananaeum vrs naeus ursan, via, beoause the power
of the “ eoelestes,'' one of whom J uno is, is great, therefore not
to be trifled with. J uno is included under the general term
caasasrun, exaotly as 1. 15, Juno’s mind is included under
“ animis oeelestibus.'’ See Remm. on “vi superum,'' 1. 8, and
on “animis eaelestibns,'' 1. 15; and compare (lio. pro Milone (ed.
Iamb, p. 556); “Neo vero quisquam aliter arbitrari potest, nisi
qui nullam eim molestam esse duait, numenve divinum,” where
“vim oaelestem'' is altogether general, is the aelestial power
eontrasted with human power ; and so in our text.

From the glosses of Servius and asaneus (“ aut per defi-
nitionem ipsa Iuno est vis deorum 3 aut per augmentum, suasit
primo per se, deinde per Iunonem, postremo per omnium vim
deorum,’' Serv. (ed. Lion) 3 ‘⁶ Seilieet aut ipsa Iuno, aut tota
manus superorum,'' Asoendus), eaoh leaving the reeder his free
ohoiee between the two rival interpretatione, aad neither making
even the slightest allusion to athird, may he inferred‚ on the one
hand, how equally divided into two eamps were aneient opinions
respeeting this passage, and, on the other, how entirely both
oamps were agreed that no third eamp was possible. 'Phe glory
of forming the third eamp was reserved for Peerlkamp: “ For-
tasse naeus pro rea magnas, monum oo memorabile serioue o te
aspectat, ut peroptima eo Italia pelloe.'' But why should anti·
quity be so divided into two oamps respeoting the meaning of
this passage? Why should Donatus have no doubt or hesita-
tion in referring to J uno alone an expression at first sight so
plainly retenible to oelestial or divine power generally, cannas-
uun vrs naeus? an expression whioh in the form of “ vis oaelee·
tie’' is so olearly and nnequivoeally used by Oioero (aa above)
without the least relerenee to J uno, and in the plain obvious
and grammatieal sense of the words: celestiol or divine power, tte
orbatial or divim potuer by retiola the roorld ia yooerned ; the “ vis

should Servius represent the two so very different interpreta-

oourse, with first plaoe first importauoe, to the interpretation,
