perior toresight. Seoondly, that, aooording to this interprete·
tion, the address of Nautes to Aeneas should oontain in it an .

explanation either of what was portended hythe raa nanu, or
of what was required by the orno rarorum, or of both; whereas,
on the eontrary, it oontains not eren one single word oonoern-
ing either the one or the other, and oonsists wholly in advim

to Aeneas, what, aooording to Nautes' opinion, was best to
be done in the present diffionlty. Thirdly, that, ll this edwioe
of Nautes to Aeneae had oonsisted (as, aooording to this in·
terpretation, it should have consisted) oi the authoritatire
oommands oi the gods, ol respousa what the ras naun, or
ranoauu orno, or both, demanded, there was in that ease
no neoessity, no “dignus rindioe nodus,'' for the appearanoe ·
of the shade of Anohises‚ to repeat almost totidem soth the
oraoular response. All these objeotions are got rid ol at onoe,
by understanding our author, immediately efter mention-
ing the name ol Nautes (run samon narras), to proeeed, eo·
oording to his usual manner (see Rem. on 6. 83) to explain who

this Nautes was, via, that he was one whom Pallas had rendered ⁴

the words marasan musra nara, to prooeed further to explain .
what he meant by those words, vin, that Pallas was in the habit
of giving Nautes responsas when he inquired ol her respeeting
future events. The sentenoe thus oontains two parentheses:
one (rin, from annu to narn inolusive) dependent on narras,
the other (vin, from aare to orno inolusive) dependent on rw·
aaran uonna nnrn3 and the narrative, broken off at nnuma,
and interrupted by the two parentheses, is reaumed at moun.
Compare the similar parenthetio description by Nalerius Flaoous
(1. 228) of the prophetie powers of Idmon:
