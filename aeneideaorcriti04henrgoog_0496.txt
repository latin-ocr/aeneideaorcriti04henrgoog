‘⁴ musica contingens subtili stamina pulsu.”

Iu raassnrusus (vs. 17).- These words, though in the
grammatica] construction belonging to uusr alone, belong in
the sense to all the animale equally, according to Virgil’s usual
habit of making up the whole complex thought by means 01
separate sentences, caah sentence containing some idea not con-
tained in any of the other sentences, yet intended to cpply in
the sense to the aggregate 01 all the sentences. Of which species
oi composition no less than two other instances are afforded by
this very passage, axsunuu, urucaa nncusaurun, and sana
sus uocra, belonging in the grammar to the first clauae only,
botin the sense to the aggregate 01 the olauses; while ronnas,
belonging in the grammar to the last clause alone, belongs in
the sense no less to all the preceding clauses, the animale men-
tioned in those clauses being no less formae than the wolves.
Compare “ forma tricorporis umbrae,’' 6. 289, where see Rem.

For another example oi the same kind see ll. 184:

“ iam pater Aeneas, inm curvo in littore Tarchon
constituere pyras,”

where ‘⁶ curvo in littorc'' is intended to be understood no less 01
Aeneas than 01 Tarchon, This kind 01 composition is occasion-
ally met with in English, where, however, it seems ascribable
ratberto slovenliness, or incapacity to write better, than either
to oboioe and intention, or the genius of the language. Ec. qr,
in Gray's so celebrated, so universally·admired Elepy, we have
the following stanza:

“ no further sech his merita to dicolose
or draw his frailties from their dread abode;
there they alike in trembling hope repcse,
the bosom 01 his Father and his G0d,”

where although the predication is only that the bosom 01 God is
the abode oi youth's frailties, the sense is that itis the abode

equally 01 his irailties and his merite.
