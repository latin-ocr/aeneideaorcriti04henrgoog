of the Rhene whieh has not yet left the Alps, whioh is still flow-
ing among the Alpe, vin, all that pert of the Rhene above the
leke of Genera, and whieh only in a very wide sense is the
eaput ol the river. If itis in this sense our author employs
cerer in our text, and the souroe of the Tiberis not meant, but
the upper part oi the river as eontredistinguished from the part
near the sea, then causis onerans must he understood to be in
the ablativo ease, and the sense to be the supper port os my stream
comes out from lofty sities, i. e., from a landfull os loftp sities,
cenem uaarsus depende on the nx oi mum, and eomesponds in
every respeot to the “aggeribus Alpinis'' and “rupe nivali” ol
Silius, and mm ie applied to the issuing forth not of the river's
spring from the ground, but ol the river itseli from Etruria (“De
Tusoia quam illis multum constat floruisse temporibus,” Servius).
If the former explanation be adopted, Aeneae in his reply uses
axrr in the preeise sense in whieh it is here used by Tiberinus,
end the rorrr, uscos and soso ofAeneas's speeeh arethe csrur
ol Tiberinus's. If the latter explanation be preferred, Aeneas
does not so strictly eonfine himself to the thought ol Tiberinus,
and instead of speakIng as Tiberinus had spoken oi the eountry
out of whieh Tiberinus flows, varies the thought so lar as to
speek oi the oountry in whioh Tiberinus riees, the same ooun-
try and the same river being ull the while meant by both
speakers. In favour oi the latter explanation is the almost
perpetual junotion oi exire with the ablativo ease no less by
Virgil himself—and so' near as the very reply of Aeneas: eoo·
cusona soso PULcmltmus urs—than hy all other authors, es
Ovio, Fasti, t. 709: “Mediis altaribus anguis erit? The de-
soription whieh Tiberinus gives of himself to Aeneas in the
words onnsrs curor usersos nxrr, in whiehever oi their two
possible senses those words be taken, has a parallel, as exact as
it is possible for the parallel between a river anda lake to be, in
the deeeription which the supposed Thrasymenus gives oi him·
