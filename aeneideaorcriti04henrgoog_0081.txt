isoeterts partlm in proportien to the foroe applied by the rower
te the ear's ether end or handle. Let us tske our simplest ne·
tion of sowing, via, that of rowing in suoh manner that eaeh
suooessive stroke is made only efter the preceding stroke has
oessed te operate. In this mode of rowing thare is no less of
rowing foros—the water receives st every stroke the whole foroe
both ef oar and rower—but there isless of time, the rower
remaining idle aa long as the offset ef eaeh last infiioted stroke
oontinues. Thia less of time (and therefore of velooity) is onlp'⁷
to be avoided by a repetition of tha stroke while the boat is still
under the influenoe of the former stroke, i. a, while the bostis
still in motion. But while the hest is still in motion the oar,
too, is in motion, osrried forwsrd by tha boot in the point-blank
opposite direotien to thet whioh its blade must take in order te
striks the water. There is therefore in this, the usual mode ef
sowing, aloes of rewing foroe, a loss whioh inoreases in proper·
tion to the inereasing velooity of the beat, end which we oen
imagine to increase until the blado of the oar is osrried forward
or away from the water, at the same instent in whieh it touohes
and even before it touohes it. In suob esse the sensatior oem-
munioated to the rower is not that ol being eerried, himself and
his oar, forward and onward from the water, but that of the
water having been drawn swsy baokwsrds from his oar, and it
isthis sensatior whieh our author has described in the words
sosrssmros sorus. To say thot the ground is subtraotad
from the, oers (er rewers) is therefore equivalent to seping that
the bost is going st the greatest spsed at ehieh it is possible ier
ests to mnke it ge. The oers een no longer esteh the sessu er
water, are enrried swey from it by the slrsady aequired impetus
before they ean striks it, ond further sowing beoomes impossible
until the already aeqused impetus slaokens et isset, so es no·
