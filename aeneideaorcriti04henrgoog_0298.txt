‘⁴ ut esse Phoebi duloius lumen solet
iam iam cadentis, astra oum repetunt vises,
premiturque dubius nocte vicina ΜΡ

[Aliter] Iuennrau Luwsu.—“ Cuius lux nubibus ineerta
et dubia redditur, qnae modo splendet, modo nubibus obseura·
tur,’' Forbiger. No, no; the light by wbioh Aeneas and the
Sibyl were walking was not sometimes bright and sure, and
sometimes dim, like the light oi a sometimes olouded‚ sometimes
unolonded moon, but always dim and unsure. And suoh pre-
oisely is the meaning oi ruonarau in our text; unoertain‚ not
from being sometimes oleer, and sometimes olouded, but unoer-

owing to clouds, so that it is diffioult to know certainly that the
moon is actually there-is aetually' present at all. Compare Ovid,
Met. 2. 808.·

[and the stara are bedimmed, shine no longer elear and bright].
Inoertns in this use is equivalent to our dim, and to the
Romans supplied the plaoe ol that term, while its eontrary
sertus expressed our clear, drigki, certain, and, as we say vul·
garly, ao mistate.

The “ luna'’ spoken of here, as well as at verse 454, being
plainly the material moon, not the goddess Luna, the word in
both plaoes should be spelled with a small initial letter, not, as
most nnaooountably both by Heyne and Wagner (by the latter
even in his Viry. Br. Ea), with a capital.
