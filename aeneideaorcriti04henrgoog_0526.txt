verba—animo naumis-atqua ut omnia oongruere videt veteri
illi oraoolo, oontinuo salvere iubet terram sibi debitam,’' Wag-
ner (ed. Heyn.). This explanation, whieh is asold as Paulinus,
Via S. Martia. 5, of the dumb girl restored to her speeoh hy
St Martia:
‘⁴ ae primum trepidam proprie signare loquelam
incertosque sonos, genitoris nomine [Q ,2 nomina]‚ rrunpsit.

leaeo eoa primafuit, prfmoqua loquama atero
eripuit pater, atquo auditam io viscera mer-siff),

isto me as unsatisfactory aa the most of those, all of them very
unsatisfaotory, explanatione whioh have uppenrod of the passage
from the time of Paulinus down to the present. Panssrr does
not mean “ animo rnnssrr,’' i. a, as expressed in another plaoe
(ed. 1861) by the same commentator, “ eeleriter exeepit et ed
animum admissam paulisper taeitus mente volutavit,’' beoause
the words sarrurr and courruuo plainly indioate that tho aet
of Aeneas was sudden, and without the smallest delay, or time
taken for refleotion. Enrrulr and rasss1r are olosely oon-

from the mouth of the speaker, and rursm held itfaet, via, by
impressing it on his own mind3 ι’. a, the allusion being to tha
quiek, dealing, winged nature ef words (επειι πτεροεντα). Aeneas
hy impressing the word on his own mind kept it from flying
away and being lost: aa if Virgil had said, arrpuit tenuitque.
