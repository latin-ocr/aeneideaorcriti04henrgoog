772 susumus [ees-708 marrus-ruris

The old error of too literal translation, oi supposing two things
to be spoken of when it is only one thing is spoken oi3 oi under·
standing sentences which are only frastions oi one thought, and
therefore unintelligible until united together by the reader's un·
deretanding, to express so many distinet independent thoughts.
The line speaks not ol the srurrns suiuus, and of the voss·
rma serron as two distinet instrumenta, but as together oon·
stituting one instrument (rin, the malleolus). Srurrns rannus
is tbe fleming tow contained in the ventriculus of the malleolus
(“ lampas,'' 9. 535 3 “ spolis,” Oynth. Cenat. ad 9. 535„ vons-
rura rursusi, the iron shait or handle of the same malleolus,
hepar, or spolia. Tame is the weapon formed by the nnion oi
the two. Nay, not only ean its separate meaning be assigned
to eaoh individual Latin word, but the entire sense of the Iatin
sentenoe oan be expressed in English in a sentenoe oonsisting of

the same preoise number oi words as the Latin sentenoe, and
tallying with the Latin santanae word ior word: “the volatile
iron weapon with ita flaming tow is soattered by tha hend3 ’⁹ or,
“ the flaming tow with its volatile iron weaponis soattemd by

the hand;'’ or “the volatile iren-and·flaming·tow weapon is
soattered by the hand.’' Srnrrss suiuus being the essential
thing, is pleoed first3 renis vonimus reason, the methed of
using or applying the srurrns suanus, being oi less impert·
anae, is relegatad to the less importent position, the end oi the
verse; while to the aetion oi throwing, expressed by srsnerrun,
is assigned the emphatio position ef last viord of the sentenee
and first word of the new verse (see Rem. on 2. 247), aposition
as often as possible reserved ior the word expressive of the aetion
of an agent desoribed in an immediately preeeding verse, and
espeoielly emphatio when, as in this ease, followedby a lull

pause, a full pause affording the reader time to dwall in thought ’

on the eontinued aetion expressed hythe word, belore he pro-
