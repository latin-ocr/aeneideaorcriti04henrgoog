Cleopatra’s death, aud on the other hand are puanled to know

“Sequitur ferte Virgilius lamam aliquam, duos eam angues sibi

Forbiger. The difficulty is, as I think, wholly ‘ol the eommen-

of Cleopatra on the shield, indIeate, not at all that she is to die
by the bite of an aspie, but that her death and rein are im·
