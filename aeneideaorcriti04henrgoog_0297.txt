either by woods or high grounds, he was still doubtful whether
the moon was aotually above the horizon ¹or not. 'Phat suoh is
the true interpretation of our text first ooourred to me on a olear
dark night, as, walking from SestodiLevantetoBorgo,Iwatehod

Lucu unumne-These words explain the kind of light

the 1uoanrau suurn sua nucu uaniora of our tent represents
the twilight of the rising moon, so the “ dubius dies noete wioina''
