but spears resembling roastiug spite in the shape of their bladae.

Tusurr uucsoun vnsuous assumo-I. a, with the oss-u
Sabellum, a spear the blado end of whioh is not flat or ehorp·

Iunurus our1r1.-“ Non oonveniunt rnouuuu munusue,
munros car1r1,” J ahn. “ Eiioe versum importunum mourus
osrrrr s1c susm raom assiam, quae a sensu et looo aliena
sunt, et iuncturam verborum eneosnt‚'’ Hoyne. “ Apparet, ex
more vulgaris sermonis haeo, roseumve et runurus, oopula

The lion's skin is to be understood as oovering both the head
and body of the woarer, the fane appearing through the rietus.
Camilla's tiger's skin was, no doubt, worn after the same
fushion, ll. 577:

‘⁶ tigridis exuviae par dorsum u vartioo pendent.’'

Compare the similar equipmont of Ornytus, oonsisting of aoow's
skin alred out with the skin and teeth of a wolf's head, 11. 679:

⁴ ⁴ oui pellis latos humeros erepta iuvenco
pugnatori operit; caput ingens oris hiatus
et malso texere lupi oum dentibus olbis.'’
