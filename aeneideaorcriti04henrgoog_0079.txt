64 AENEIDEA [leo-197 arrienos—weris

that, not merely in the same passage, but in the same sentence
and same breeth, it is this very vinoere. The followingis one
example out of a thousand, J ustin. 12. l: “Agis rex, oum suos
terga dantes rideret, dimissis satellitibus, ut Alexandro felioitete
non virtute inferior videretur, tentam stragem hostium edidit,
ut agmine interdum lugeret. Adpostremum,eteiamultitudine
vietus, gloria tamen omnes oioit’' where, although the eeoond
vincere has even more the appearanoe of being used in the
same sense ae the first than the seoond vinoere of Mnestheus
has, few will be found hardy enough to maintein that it is

l aetually so used, and not rather iii the oognate sense of exoeed·
ing, exoelling, surpassing.

Naris.—“ Modo opprobrium, [quod] est viro forti, in quo·
ounque eertemine perdere,'’ Servius (ed. Lien). “Naris,
magna oum vi pro opprobio ut et Servius notavit,’' Heyne. “ In
hoo oernatur viatoria vestre, ut ne extremi redeamus, quod est
ingentis dodeooris‚'' Wagner. “ Hano ignominiam, hoo oppro-
briam, seiz. exranrios nabrissa, nitendo effugite,” Forbiger
(ed. 4). “A disgraoe not to be named,” Conington ; and in his
translation the same commentator:

‘⁴ nottobelast, maliethat your aim,
and hiumph by averting shame.”

As if there were any instenoe known of netes signifying either
“disgressa'’ or “shame,” “ignominia'’ or “opprobrium'’ or
as if any one ot these commentatore themselves, on the question
, being put to him without reference to Virgil, as to the meaning
of nefas, would not have answered unheeitatingly: erfo, offerire
against leooeo. There is as muoh differenoe between rnoiiiaarii
uaris interpreted to mean bar tle rhome, and raoninnrn uinis·
interpreted to meander the siri, as there is between to conimit
mearder, it icere o atoma, and to commit murder, it sewu o eiii ; or as
there is between ‹fieod not against publio opinion, and offam not
against heaven. It seems almost as it oommentators were in

taoit league to emasoiilate Virgil.
