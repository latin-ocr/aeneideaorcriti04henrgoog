928 AENEIDEA [ota-sis osroenos-mausus

(Eteooles apostrophiaing Jupiter, aud thanking him for hie
(Jupiter’s) pomonal intervention in defenoe of Thebes):
. . . “ceuregisoaeli
attentata tui, sio te pro tamtus allia

vidimus urgentem nubes, lateque benignum
fulmen, et auditos proavis agnovimus ignes ;”

Claud. cle Bello Gild. 15. 85 (personified Rome speaking) ε ·

‘⁴ muru sustinui Martem, nentesque eruentae
Collina pro tum tuli,'’

still, suah is not their meaning in the oontext in whioh they
stand, inasmuoh as in this sense the words are equally appli-
oable to the young men, whether they keep the gates olosed or
open them3 whereas it is quite plain that the author intende to
say that the young men stand nno sosarnus only aflet· they
huwe thrown the gates open, and deerrare they had thrown the
gates open.

Neither explanation of the words, therefore, satisfias me,
although either explanation might suit them in another oorrtext,
and Ι look for a third explanation, whioh shall suit not merely
the use of the worda separately taken, but their use in this
partioular oontext als03 and eueh explanation immediately pre·
sente ifeelf. The young men “astant'' neither with Donatus
‘⁶ hugo ae towers,'' nor with Serviue's seoond explanation, “ pro
defensione turrium3 ad defendendae turres;” but they stand, to
use the two first words ol Donatus (without, however, under·
standing those two words as Donatus himself hee explained
them), “ viae turrium,’' in phase ⁰f torrere, performing the part
of towers, defending the oity, whioh, ite gates being now open,
was no longer defended by ite towers. Ammian. 14. 2, a:
‘⁶ et oum . . . ud superoilia venissent fluvii Melania alti et
vortieosi, qui pro maso tuetur aeoolas oirunmfmns, . . . quievere
paulisper luoem opperientes ;’' not, surely, the river as high as
a wall, but the river which amiserat iu place of a trull, the river
whioh defended the wullese oity. Ovid, Fasti, 1. 565 (of the

eave of Caene) ε

ιι ml& domo longis spelunea recemibus ingens
abditu, rix ipsis invenienda teris ;”
