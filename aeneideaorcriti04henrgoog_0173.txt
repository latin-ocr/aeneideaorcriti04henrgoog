158 auhuman [545-602 ne nunna-uenus

tereth, ο. 2 :
“ but now, beneath the lcfty amsel's stern,
a shoal ci sporting delphina they discam,
beaming [uuonan rmcmr]‚ from burnished wales, refulgent rays,
till all the glowing ocean seems to blnze:
in curling wreaths they wauton on the tide,
now bound eloft, now downward swiitly glide;
a while beneath the werce their traeks romain, ,
and bum in silvcr chasma along the liquid plsin.”
Compare Pliny, Nat. Her. 9. 8: “ Velocissimnm omnium ani·
mulium, non solum merincmm, est delphinus, ocior volucre,
aanor telc.''
usonem nuuc ranas racmuuu nrcrucu seuera (vs. 602).
-Tbe Princeps, the two Heinsii, Maittaire, Heyne, Wagner,
and Fcrbiger, divide this line into two parts by a comma placed
after uuae. The effect cithia punctuation is, first, wholly to
deslnoy the cadenoe citha verse, and secondly, to outlaw end
place beyond the grammatical pale both sections citha line ;
the first seotion presenting a subject without verb cr predicate,
the second a superfluous subject yched tc a verb in a totally
different regime. The comma being placed aiter runn1‚we
obtain, first, a pause which not only dces not ahoek, but is agree·
able to, the ear3 and secondly, the simple and natural structure
ruam uuna (sacratur) ua01a3 acuns mmmm uncianum. The
statement ruam usuc (dicuntur) raom is expressly confirmed
by several ancient historiens, especially by Suetonius, Jrclics
Cacsar, 39 .· “ Troiam lusit turma duplex maiorum minorum-
que pueroram.” See Aca. t. 56, for a line beginning with the
aelfsume words and having the pause in the selfsame situation.
In like manner, the cuuth line ci the first book of Ovid’s
Metamorphoses, bad grammar and unintelligible aa it stands iu
the editions,

“ sic deus et virge ast: hie spe celer, illa timore,’'

is rendered beth good sense and good grammar by the transfer
cf the colon tc the other eide of the word “ est '':

“ sie daus et virgo : est hic spe celer, illa timore.'’
