Pravooua roraurnsr raamcrnu (vv. 844-5).—“In parva
re domestioa divitem,'' Heyne, Thiel, Ladewig, Forbiger, Wag-
ner (1861), Conington3 not merely erroneously, but with an
utter perversion oi Virgil's meaning, whiehis not that Fabrioius
was riah in his poverty (“ Qui etiam in parva re domestiea ob
parsimoniam et rontinentiam dives est,'' Forbiger, ard ed), but
that Fabrioius was powerful (influential and respested, >a great

“ agrieolae prisci, fortes parvoque beati.”

But itis not so Virgil has thought proper to represent him.
Virgil has thought proper to represent him-a muoh greater
praise-as poweriul on little, i. a, powerfnl without riahes,
poweriul without owing his power to wealth, powerhrl there
fore by his virtue alone (“ Fabrieium vorat aravo rosnarum,
quia oum summa esset frugalitate, tamen insignis admodum
fnit rebus gestis,'' La (larda), the very piature given oi him by
Seneea, Epist. 190: “ Maiusque regno iudioavit regias opes posse
