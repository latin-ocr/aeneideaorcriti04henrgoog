Sio effioietur‚ ut nomen Mareelli-non iam illius qui bello
Punioo seeundo magnas res gessit, sed ipsius filii Ootaviae-
bio demum positum singularem habeat vim ad miserationem
movendam,’' Wagner. anh aritio is half right and half wrong;
Wagner is right that the person meant by nenorosus is the son
ol Octavia, but wrong that s1 oua rara asenna sourasis an
exolamation. Heyne is right that the words sr oon rara
ssrssa neuras express the condition on whioh the lad will
beoome Mareellus, via, if he does not die prematurely, but wrong
that nascamus means a Marcellus, a second Marcellus, and not
speoifioally Mareellus the son of Ootavia. The whole meaning
is certainly and beyond doubt: Aa! toy to be pinel, only line
ereditas alrolt be alre perclo tarplrt, aa nzass of sterling reor-tls arad
leonesty, tlre irrairrritle roarrior·; in one word, lton stult be Mareel-
los. The gist of the passage is that the rusa, the young son of
Octavia, would be only the “spes Mareelli,” tte pronubo ofMar·
sellas, not be really Mareellus, not deservo to be oahed Marcellus,
until grown up3 but he was lated not to grow np3 was not to
break through his rara assuas, and therefore Anchises (in
imagination) throws flowers upon his tomb; observo, not on
Mareellus’s tomb, but upon the tomb auroris, of Anchises' de·

soendant, the young son ol Octavia. Compare Vol. Flaoo. 3.
183:

. . . “spesmaximabellis
pulcher Hylas, si fata sinant, si prospera Iuno.”

Oia. Orat. 30 .· “ Adolesosns non tam re et maturitate, quam spe
et expeotatione laudatus.’'

Tu MARCELLUS aurs (vs. easy—Toou stall te Marcellos
(Mareellus, the son of Octavia), exaotly as verse 846: “ tu
Maximus ille es,’' thou art tto! Maximae.
