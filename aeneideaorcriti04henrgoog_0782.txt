D. Heinsius, Peerlkamp, aud Ribbeok understanding the words
in the former oi these sensesr N. Heinsius, Jahn, Forbiger‚
Thiel, Voss, Ledewig. aud Wagner in the latter: and Heyne
vaoillatIng between the two. Το me it seems perleotly oertain,

that notwithstanding the objections raised to it, espeeially by
Peerlkamp, the latter sense is the true one-(l), and prinoi-
pally beoause the passage was sertainly so understand by
Silius, who in no less than two different accounts of Geryon

plainly borrows more or less oi his materiale from this aoeouut
oi Herilus‚ Sil. l. 278:

“ tres animas namque id monstrum, trer corpore dextras
amarae, ternaque eaput serviae gerebat,”

where we have not only Virgil's rans snruss wholly unaltered,
and Virgil's raras arus moveram barely appreciahly altered,
but the very same eonnexion oi “ animae'' with “ arma,’' whioh
in the Virgilian text hasbeen sueh a stumbling·bloek to the
sommentators. Id. 13. 200:

“ qualia Atlantiaco memoratur littore quondum
monstrum Geryones immane tricorporis irae,
oui tres in pugnam dextrae varia arana parabant.
una ignes saevos, ast altera pone sagittas
fundebat, validam torquebat tertia cornum,
atque uno diversa dabat trio vulnera nisu,“

where the triple arms of the monster, all wielded at ones, are so
munh and at suoh length insisted on, that our wonder is not
that Virgil should have given arms to eaoh one of the “ animae”
ol Herilus‚ but that he should have eontented himself with so
briei and modest a mention oi arms as numerous as the lives
ot the monster. And (2), my seoond reason ior adopting
this interpretationis no less strong than my first, viz, that
rorrnrsr nxurr arms, vs. 567, so plainly refers to three sets oi
arms previously mentioned, that either this interpretation must
be admitted, or the olause somnam axum sams be rejeoted

as spurious, an alternative to whioh Peerlkamp, an adopt at
exeision, has had no objeotion.
