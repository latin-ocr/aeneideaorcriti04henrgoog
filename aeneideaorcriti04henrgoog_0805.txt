774 AENEIDEA [694-708 srurrss-—rrurs

On the eontrary, the words ruva Nova uersuum ‚casus uum
nnscuur arethe summing up ottho whole, express the result
ol the uus ouurs nunus, of the rrum uois vuu runmms
rurrrs'us msraur, of the srurrss FLAMMA rasso ramesen
vosrrmn rnatum ersuorruu. 'without the addition of the red·
dening ot the eea with the fresh blood, there is no oonsequenoe,
no result maun from all the previous struggle, not even so muoh
as one single* mention of the shedding of blood until you oome
to mres canons, fourteen lines further on. This is, Ι think, a
suffioient oondemnation ot the interpretation oi Peerlkamp, even

if thet interpretation did not neoessitate a merely oonjeotural
alteration of the text.

But while Wagner's interpretation is eorreot in so far as it
understands cruos of the spilled blood, and rsovs to mean that
the blood was newly spilled, yet it is, as Ι think, ineorreot, iu
sofar as it understands this ooo spilling of the blood to be the
spilling of the blood in the beyinulnp ot the battle, “ ad initium

pugnae respici.” Nova is here, as Ι think appears from the

exemplos quoted above, a mere heightening or oolouring epi·
thet, an epithet of that hind whioh is eommonly denominated
coustant, and refers not to the beginning or any other special
part ottho battle, but to the freshness, or fresh appearanoe ol
the blood-you see lla Noplortlau fielda prouinq red will lbo nozcly-
spilled blood, ocllb lbo ‚srael blood. 'Phe “ eaedes’' strikes the

reader's imagination the more, beoause itis lresh, not of old
date. Solo. 325:

‘⁶ dum sequeris Clytium infelix, moa gaudia, Cydon.'’

Clytius is the new delight ot Cydon, not beoause Cydon had
other previous or old delights, but beoause he had not this de·
light long3 it was not of old standing3 he was, ae we say in
English, onero-fimyled with it.

Arva uersuum crans honesturn-The seu bobius lo prou

red ru'lb blood, exaotly as elsewhere the earth begins to grew red
with blood. Compare Sil. 4. 204 ε
