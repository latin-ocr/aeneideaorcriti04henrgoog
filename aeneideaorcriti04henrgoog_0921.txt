with an explanation, aooording to whioh frangere is collidere,
and the wood of a shield is split, not piereed (or hored) by a
speer. But Servius need not have despaired; there was another
way out of it, whioh La (lerda, less blear·eyed, if you believe
himself, than Servius, found out. We have only to diseurd the

Nonius or Servius, and adopt a reading adording an' exsotly
opposite sense: we have only :to substitute, er 'conjectura svansr ’

upon Servius, Heyne isin a downright passion with him. 'Phe
