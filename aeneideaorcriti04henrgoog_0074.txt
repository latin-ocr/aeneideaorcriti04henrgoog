“Das wendet, 0 biirger, wendet 100 griucl durch sieg,'’
J. H. Voss. “ lungendum 000 00000,” Wagner (1832). “ Hoc
detestabile dedecus effugite nitendo,’' Id. (1845 and 1849). “ In
hoo cernatur victoria vestra, ut 00 extremi redeamus, quod est
ingentis dedecoris,'’ Id. (1861). “Hoc warns vrwcrra nr 000-
fflnara,” Thiel. “Hanc ignominiam, rroc opprobrium, soiz.
exrannos 0000000, 0110010 effugite,'' Forb. (ed. 4). Το which
construction 01 the passage I object-linet, that no example hes
yet been addueed cf the conjunction 01 the verb vincere with
the object nefas. Secondly, that the only known meanmgs of
vincere being 10 coaqacr, 10 coccea, 1000111000, and 10 proce, the
meaning 01 vrncrra werse, 11 such expression were possible,
must be either conquat· 110010, or caceed 110010, or 00101000 tte cin,
or prece 110 aie, 001 000 01 which meanings affords any sense in
the context in which the words here 01001. And thirdly, that
it is little probable that the poet who has but just now, viz. 01
the 001 01 the iomth book, won cur admiration by the strength,
brevity, 001 oleamess 01 the 'expressions in which 0 highly excited
Dido gives vent tc her passion, should here so soon afterwards,
rin. in the beginning 01 the fifth, put into the mouth ol his
scarcely less excited Mnestheus a sentence consisting 01 two
0100000 so implicated together as 10 10, both 01 them, absolutely
unintelligible until the last word 01 the second 01 them hasbeen
uttered. For these reasons I reject the construction 000 warne
vrwcrrn nr raonrssrn, and adopt the alternative construction
noc vrwcrra nr 00000 Ρο0100000; the 000 vrwcrra 01 this eon-
struction having its parallel 00 1000 10 the “primum hoc vincat,
servasse parentem'' 01 Silius, 4. 429, than in the “neo vincet
ratic hoc” cl Horace, Sat. 1. 3. 115; and the 0000100000 naras
