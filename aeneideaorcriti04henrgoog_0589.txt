ner. “Quum cerneret faciem Furiae, deposita anili forma, ex·
crescentem in ingentem magnitudinem nisi quis velit esse
explicationem superioris3 i.e. tot ss hydrorum facies aperue-
runt, et serpentium hiatus ostentarunt‚'' Lemaire. But the
only word requiring explanation is precisely the word all these
commentatore have left unexplained, vin, namne. The question
is, what is meant by this word ramas—whether the face, as
their sufficiently obscure words seem to indicate (“ vultu quem
flnxerat,'' Servius), or the whole ligure, form, appearance of the
Fury. Thac itis the latter, not the former, I have no doubt;
and I think the word naurs shows plainly that itis, unless
indeed we are content to imagine that the Fury's stature re- '
mained ol the siae smtable to Galybe while her iace assumed
snormous proportione, a picture methinks fitter lor a modern
nursery tale than for the Aeneid. No, no; racrns is the whole
aspect, form, appearance of the Fury, snlarged to her natural
siae, and hissing with all her serpente, the person or ligure of
the Fury. And so Voss, correotly: “so grass breitet sich aus
die gestalt. We have the same term applied to the whole ap·
pearance of ame, 6. 575: “ iacies quae limina serratl'' aa
we would say: “What a figurel'' Oompare 8. 194, where
“Caci facies dira” is not tae dircsoce of Oscae, but Occus'e dire
serm, tle direfiyare of Oocus; also 12. 416: ‘⁴ faciem circumdata
nimbo'' [aot with a nimbus about her face, bot with a nimbus

about her whole person]; and Manil. 2. 755:

“ ut rudibus pueris monstratur litera primum
perfactam nomenque suum.'’

It is in this sense, not in the restricted or special sensa offane,
that the word f acies is oftensst used by Virgil.

With cur text, compare further-the probable source whence
Virgil drew this very grand picture-the account Callimachus
has given in his Hyom to Ocrea, ol that goddess appearing
under the form ol Nicippe‚ the hesper of her temple, with her
tillet and other emblems in her hand, to the man who violated
the sanctity of ber templs by cutting down the sacred trees:
compare her ordering him to desist, and when he not only re-
