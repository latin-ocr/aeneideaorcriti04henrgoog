inille manner, when Paris is about to 1011011 101 Sparta, his
parents endeavour 10 dissuade him, “pia voee,'' 10, 101 with
the voioe 01 authority, but ol aiieotion, 101 his own good, Ovid,
Heroid. 16. 117: ’

“ 01 petar 01 genetrix inhibent mea'vota rogando,

propositumque pia 1010 morantur 1101.”

Again, when Numa, Ovid‚ Fast. 3. 335, begs Jupiter 10 tell him
what arethe piamina 101 lightning, and puts iorward two
grounds why his'prayer should be granted, 010 0111010 grounds

is his own previous purity 01 life, and observanoe 01 the worship
01 Jupiter: ⁵

‘⁴ si tua oontigimus manibus 1010110 puris ; ”

and the other is 1101 the speoial request is a “ pius” 011, 1. a,
011 made not 101 his own speoial advantage (ior Numa was 101
himself affeoted by the lightnings), but ior 111 good 01 his
oouutrymen and 01 mankind 11 general:

“ 100 quoque, quod petitur, si pu lingua rogat.”

And presisely so in our text Deiphobus qualifies his prayer 101

gratiiy 0 personal revenge, but 101 111 1010 01 my relatives,
friends, follow-sountrymen and mankind. About the ybatice
01111 retribution thore neither was 101 oould be any question:
the only question whieh either was or eould be, was whether the
· retribution was sought with an amiable 01 01 unamiable feeling:
the deeision 01 this question, and 110 0011101111 granting or
refusing 01 his prayer, Deiphobus leaves, in 110 word s1, 10110
oonsoiousness 01110 gods themselves. See Rem. 01 “ pietate,’'
l. 16; audon “pias manus,'' 3. 42.

Ι need hardly point ont to the render how very neeessary is
this apology 01 Deiphobus 101 0 nequest 11101110 gods would be
guilty towards the Greeks 01 the very same oruelty ol whioh the
Greeks had 1001 guilty to him. It is the apology put iorward
iu all ages and all oountries 101 11010 oruelties 01 sooiety towards
