—“ Maeror auro nnmerum anciran? Melius sic distinguitur,
licet quidam legunt auro rursus macrore, ut epitheton ei dent,
qui per se non 'est magnus,” Servius, followed hythe two
Heinsii, Heyne‚ Peerlkamp, J ahn, and Gossrau. “Rectius
post maenum interpungitur in Medicam nimis enim, qui antea
nominantur deprimuntur prae Hercule, sihoo epitheton in hac
versus sede collocatum adhunc trahere malis. Accedit, quod

vlinita post medium versum superiore sententia ineleganter con-
ciditur versus, si novum ordinem post rnnsns ordimur,'' Wagner
(ed. Heyn.), preceded by Voss (districtiora), und followedby
Forbiger, Ribbeck, and Conington. I entirely agree with Ser·
vius, and to the arguments ol Wagner reply (1), that the inter-

punction oi the Medioaan is of nc use or authority either here
or elsewhere (see prelatory remarks). (Ω), that i ienot to the

should always risa to, not fall from, a climax. (8), that ii there
is any character whatever which pre-eminently distinguishes the

precisely the skill and effect with which¹ they both break the
sing-song of the verse, while at the same time they excite the
⁸ expectation and interest of the reoder, by occasionally pausing
either immediately before the last ioot or last word, cr imme·
diately after the first ioot or first word of the verse. Let
enyone compare one hundred lines of the Aeaea withan equal
length of theEpitlrolamiam ofPelcus aad Thera, and say whether
he does not preter the varied cadence oi the frequently broken
and interrupted verses ot the former to the unbroken monote-
nous smoothness of the latter. 'l'he differenoe between the two
is of the same kind as in cnr own language between the per-

- petually smooth verses oi Surrey’s translation oi the Aeneia, in

which the pause is regularly at tha end of the line, and the noble
verses of Paradira Lost, in which it is, as alten as the author can
hy possibility so place it, either in the middle, near the bagin-
