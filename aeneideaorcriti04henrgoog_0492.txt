blane illuminated Calypso’s grotto and the splendid apartments .
of Ciroe.

A not very dissimilar though more hemely pieture is pre·
sented to ue Georgia 1. 291, vin, oi a oountryman sitting up late
into the night and making torehes hy the firelight whilst his
wile weaves, and aoeompanies her work with a song:

“ et quidam seros hiberni ad luminis ignes
pervigilat, tetroque faces inspicat anuto 3

interea longum cantu solata laborem
arguta coniux percurrit pectine telas.”

Pronus in verse 14 must be the shuttle3 (1) beeause it is
against all probability that Virgil should describe Ciroe as wear·
ing with the sley, a part of the wearing apparatus so totally

to be the rodina, the shuttle; (θ) beeause the motion of the
shuttle being smooth and easy, that oi the sley oonsisting in
repeated jerlrs or shoelrs, the picture of Oiroe wearing with
the shuttle is as elegantes the picture ol (lires wearing with
the sley had been inelegant. (Β), beoause the motion oi the
sley eonsisting oi repeated slepa, jerks, or shoolrs, and being

aetually so desoribed by Ovio, Met. 6. 56:
