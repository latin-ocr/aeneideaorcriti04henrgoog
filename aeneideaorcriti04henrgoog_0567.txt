Tacrrcnrunn onsnmr 01000 auersa-“Tauron pro tacite,''
Servius. “ Quia verc Amata tcta intus coquebatur curis, tcta
iris ardebat, neque se dum 00000 illae, aut 1000 manifestave-
rant‚'' La (lenda. “Aut pro tacita cessum, ut Servius, 001
quatenus de matrisfamilias cubiculo agitur 10 secretiore domus
parte. (larda ad curas retulit; so. 01100110 sit Amata. Sed,
ut dixi, de solitudine est accipiendum, quae cum cura et dolore
mentis tacito bene convenit‚’' Heyne. “ Temnon, quo sola
secesserat Amata curis intentc,'' Wagner (Praesit). I entirely
agree with Servius, first, because it 10 001 necessary 10 say any·
thing in this verse about Amata’s 01010 01 mind, the whole of
the two immediately subsequent verses being devoted solely 10
thet subject ; secondly, because it 10 necessary 10 say that Alecto
besieged (onsnnm) Amata's door silently in order that the word
0000οι0 might not lead the reader into the opinion that she
made noise or disturbanoe, or used threats; thirdly, because at
vs. 505 we receive the preoisely similar information concerning
Alecto, vin, that she lurked “tacitis silvis,'’ where there is no
reason why the woods should be understood 10 be 10011, and
where there 10 every reason that Alecto herself should be tacit,
inasmuch as she was lying hid (“latet''); and fourthly, 1000000
1110 according to Virgil’s muel manner thus to use this word
elsewhere, as 1. 506:

‘⁴ Latonae tacitum pertentant gaudia peotue''

(where it is Latona who is silent, not Latona’e breast) ; 4. 363 z

‘⁶ totumque pererrat luminibus tacitia'’ (where it is Dido who is
silent, not Dido's eyes) 3 6. 842:

“ quia tc, magne Octo, tacitum, 00110, Cosso, relinquat? '¹

(where it is ‘⁶ quis'’ who is to keep silence, 0010010 cr 000000),
and, most remarkable of all, 2. 265: “ tacitae peramica silentia
lunae ” (where it is not the moon which keeps silence, but the

Greeks).
