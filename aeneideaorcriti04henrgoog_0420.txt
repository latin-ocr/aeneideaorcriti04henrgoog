and, still more explicit, 5. 734: ‘amoena piorum coucilia Ely-
siumque colo'? Itis as impossible, on the oue hand, that yon,
10 lately dead, should already have undergoue this tedions pur·
gatory, as it is impossible, on the other, that you should be here
in Elysium without having undergone it, without having had
your mortal alloy thoroughly purged out.'’ 'Phe two verses

to parry the further and no lese obvious inquiry, “is your stay
