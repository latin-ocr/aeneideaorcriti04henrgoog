The reading noa'rs, therefore, no matter by vehat MS.
authority supported, is to be rejected as inoompatible vrith
raanrsnnnan (for the sense it affords in eonjuuetion with that
word isne other than err-een, or protest deatb, quod absmdum),
and naam isto be adopted, whioh, in eonnexion with rann·
sennaar, afferds the uuobjeotionable sense, eet ap tte sereea of
a wall before, not the Mars oi the Rutuli, hut before year oron
Mara, 1. e. light like oowards from behind walls, under the pro·

is never to hold against, but always te bold before [via. the

honest names, not against anyone, or anything‚ hut trefrort of

lumina praetendens '’

[holding the lamp, not against anything‚ but before tianetf];
Ammian. lb. 11. 14: “dum castrorum opera mature eonsur·
grmt militisque pars stationes praetendit agrarias, alia frumenta
insidiarum metu colligit eante;'' as 11 he had said “eastris
praetendit stationes agrarias.’' Still further, praetendere
