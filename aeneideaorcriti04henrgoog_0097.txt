Summam (vs. wey-Hier ap ia tae air, above Ida.

For rarraar (vs. 253), see Rem. on l. 284 3 and ior amnas,

Inane (vs. easy-Ire, as hore used, is something more than
esse, and something less than se ferre. It may perhaps be
defined to be esso with the additional notion of motion, and se
ierne without the notion oi oonsoious dignity or importanoe.
Compare 8. 162: “sed eunetis altior ibat Anohises,'’ implying
not merely thet Anchises was tollor than all olibam, but that
Anchises went or walked tollor than all oi them. And so in our

text the suooeasiul oompetilors not only erant nvraarr, but mann
nvrnorr, not only were garlanded but were in motion also. Iithe
word ire, like our own ρο andremo, same ultimately andin looee
parlanoe to be as in Gerre. 2. ela .·

“ nso res huno tenerae possent perferre laborem,
si non tanta quies irat frigusque caloremque
inter, et exciperet oaoli indulgentia terras,”

little more than the synonym oi esse, it must originally have
oonveyed the additional idea, the proper notion ol motion, else
how oame it to be used at all? The use by the Greeks of πεφυ-
ream and τυγχανειν was preoisely similar, the former ol these
words at first and in striotness eonveying not merely the idea
oi being so orso, but ol being so or so by nature or natural dis·
position, and the latter ol being so or so by ohanoe, or happening
to bo so or so, as Eurip. Hipp. 12 (ol Hippolytus):

poros πολιτων rarle γης Τροιζηνιας,
