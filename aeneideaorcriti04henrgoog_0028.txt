If it was proper thus to apply for fair winde to the manee of
Achilles, a mere man, how much more proper was it to apply
for them to the manes of the deified Anchises, that Anchises
who had not only a“ lucus late eaeer'' but a“eaoerdoe'’ eet
apart for him (verse 760 of this book); that Anchises to whom
worship ie paid and prayere offered up, in company with Idaean
Jove, and Cybele, with Tellus, the Nymphs and rivers, Nox and
the rising constellatione, and the “ genius looi'' (7. 133) Ρ Even
independently of thie special divinity of Anchises (n1v1u1 rs·

nnuma, rs. 47), independently ol the example of winde sought ,

lor and obtained from the manee of the hero Achilles, it was
in perfect keeping with the religiose opinione of the times that
a favour should be eought for from the manes, considered
merely ae manee. All the manes were gode—dii mance
(compare Cio. dc Legit. 2. 22: “ Neo vero tam denicales, quae
a nece appellatae eunt, quia residentur mortui, quam ceterorum
caelestium quieti dies, feriae nominarentur, nisi maiores coe, qui
ex hae vita migrassent, ia morum namne esse voluissent.'' Pru·

“ acce deos raam eur inficiaris haben?
ipsa patrum monumenta probant; dle rmaibm illic
mmmora secta lego, quaecunque letina vetustos
custodit cineres, densisque Salaria busfis '' )-

and to the manee, especially il they were the manes ola
person distinguished during lile lor eminent virtue, sacrifices
were offered and vows were made by the relatives and other
persons nearly connected, and prayers put up even by total
strangers and mere passere-by: cxaotly as in Christian coun-
'tries at the present day the wayfarer stope at a wsyeide chapel,
