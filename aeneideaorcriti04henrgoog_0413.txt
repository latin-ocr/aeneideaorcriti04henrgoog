390 AENEIDEA [716-725rrs-rsm

grnity is to oonsider that the mundus, or universe of the
ancient eosmogony, was the earth 'considered as a magnum
eorpus, of whioh the snn, moon, and oonstellations were but
tho dependenoies and outfittings3 and that our author, when
speaking in our text ottho “tota moles” and the “magnum
eorpus,’' was in laet thinking only ol that great earth ol oure ot
whioh the whole of the heavens, nocturnal as well as dimnal,
was no more than the garniture. This explanation seems to
derivo no small oonfirmation from the application of this very
term “ eorpore” to the earth by Cioero, de Dr'atnat. 1. 11, in the
oourse of a poem whioh treats of the mundns in a manner so
similar to that of our text as to be quoted by commentatore aa

parallel ε

“ principio aetherio flammante Iuppiter igni
vertitur, et totum collustret lumine mnndum,
menteque divina eaelum terrasque petessit:
qnae penitus sensus hominum vitaeque retentat,
aetheris aeterni septa atque inclusa arvernis.

aut eum se gravido tremefecit corpore tallm.”

If it be objeoted that the same term is applied by Ovid, Met. 1.
18, to the ohaos out of which all things were oreated, I reply, as
before, that the ohaos of the anoients—and indeed I might say
of the moderna who, adopting the ancient theory, believe in a
ohaos-oonsisted merely of the as yet unarranged materiale of
the earth, out of which materiale issued at a oertein moment,
nobody knew why or hon, the existing arrangement of land,
water, air, light,and fire. The ‘⁴ oorpns'’ ol Ovid'e ohaos was,
then, nothing more or less than the eorpus of theos yet unar-
ranged earth, exaetly as Virgil's “eorpus magnum'' was the
eorpus ol the same earth arranged and digested into its-shall
I say organs, or shall I say departmentst-land, water, air,

light, ane ne.
