isthere added expressly for the sake of the statement that
the “ inclusae animae'' were Anchises’ own “ nepotes,’' so the
second verse of our text is the similar completion of the first,
containing as it does not merely a similar but the very same ⁴
statement, via, that the “inclusae animae'’ were the posterity
cf Anchises (Pronum unorum? And meh is by no means
exceptionally or unusually Virgil’s manner of writiug, via, to
add an additional sentence, with its own separate verb and
separate adverbs and adjectives, for every additional point cr
item which he wishes to add to the first cr principal point cr <
item. The additional point or item both in our text itself and
inita parallel is my poctarum and in order to add in thia
thought with sufficient emphasis, clearness, and fulness, the
poet adds not merely the word “ nepotes'' in the one case, and
the word raonsu in the other, but malros each word the subject
cf a new clause or sentence, supplying it with its own verb, a
varied repetition cf the original verb, with its own enhancing
adjective or adverb, cr both, and, in tha parallel case, with a
paraphernalia of no less than four secondary substantivas-all
suggested by the first additional point or item. Olearness and
distinctness‚ soundness, copiousness and richness, are the results
of this kind of construction; but apost must not be always
copious, round, and rich. He must sometimes, even attha risk
of becoming obscura, be brief and energetic, else we tire of him,
as we do ol Sponsor and Tasso. Itis with great judgment,
then, that virgil does not always use this construction, but very
frequently the opposite; and, instead of forming a new and
separate clause for his new item, puts the new item into the old
clause, attaching it, no matter how improperly (to use a favou-
rite term of the grammarians), to the original verb, and so
forcing it sometimes into very strange and, as cna might be in·
clined to think (pace talah cerniaco), very bad company. A
striking example of this kind is afforded by 10. 12:

“ cum fera Karthago Romanis arcibus olim
exitium magnum atquc Alpes immittet apertas.”

This latter construction hasbeen frequently animadverted upon
