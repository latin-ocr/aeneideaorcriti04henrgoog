238 AENEIDEA [so-54 our—corrrourr

Nou vaenue, uon conon uuus,—“Unos,'‚i.e., idem atque
antes,'' Forbiger, Thiel, Voss, Conington. If this interpreta-
tion be eorreot, the pieture presented hythe poet is that of a
transfiguration‚ like that of Giuseppe, while he is in the aot of
explaining to his Egyptian wife the nature ottho God of the
Jews, Metast. Gr'osrppe Birra:

Assa. ‘⁴ ah qual reggio divino
ti [Giuseppe] balena sul volte! In questi aceenti

But the interpretation is, I think, ineorreot, and the pioture pre-

different oharaoter for each of the four different parts of the
oration, aa, four different eharaeters, or a eharaoter ohanging
four times); Plaut. Mil. 3. 1. 129 .· “ne uuo exemplo omnes
vitam viverent ’³ [different persons should live in different man-
ners]). Thirdly, beoause a frequent change oi vonros and
cosor agrees, better than a single· ohange, with the state into
whioh the Sibyl is brought by the divine “afflatus'’ with ber
“ rabies,’' with her raas corun, with her ruerus annaeum, with
her now courum maresan conns, with her “ os rabidum,’' with
