an altar is an impenetrable shiold, a better well oi 'delenoe than
a tower3 oud Aesoh. Pers. 85 7 .·

:para por saderiano στρατια* atspwoust' nde νομισματα τυργινα

tower laws, i. o. lawe as sure and strong and reliable ae towers Ι
directed everything. Compare Sir Walter Soott, Mormion,
Canto 5, Introd. :

‘⁴ ne’er readisr at alum-belle eall
thy burghers rosa to man thy wall,
then non, in danger, shall be thino,
thy dauntlsss voluntary line ς
forfasse and turret proud to stand,
their &mis tiu bawarri of too law

What wonder that our author's nno ruanraus uerear should

have given oommentatore some trouble, expressing, as it does,
in three short words the entire thought whioh Sir Walter Seott

Ι was unable to express in less then a oouplet?

Pao munerans = vire turrium, exaotly as “pro domino’'
= br'oe domini, in Maerob. sat. 1. 11. 16 .· “ Qui (Urbinas) oum
iussus oooidi in Reatino lateret, latebris proditis, unus ex servis,
anulo eius et veste insignitus, in onbioulo, ed qnod irruebant
qui persequebantur, pro domino iaouit, militibusque ingredien-
tibus oervioem praebuit, et iotam tanquam Urbinas exeepit.''
Exaotly similar to Virgil's rao runnrnns in our text is Luoan’s
rao vuuunas (9. 809), where that author, desorihing the
poisonous effeots of the bite ol the hemorrhois, says:

. . . “ omnia mambra
emisere simul rutilum pro respuisse virus.
sanguis erant lacrimas: quascumque foramina norit
humor, ab his largus manat cruor: ora redundant,
et patulae aaran sudor rubet; omnia plenis
membra fluunt venis : totum eet pro vulnere wrpus,''

i. e. as we say, tho obolo bodyir one wound, or is ae good as a
wound. So common, indeed, is the form ol expression, that we
have it twiee in this one passage ol Luoan, “pro sangnine’'
being or'oe sanquine, exaotly as “Proeonaul'' is vioe cornutis,
