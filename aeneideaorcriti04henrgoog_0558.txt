but there being no such grounds lor Aeneas's being so regarded,
the parallel would have been poetical indeed, bnt'not logical.
On the other hand, if the parallel had been instituted in the
second of the above iashinna it would have been perfectly logi·
eal, because there was an absolute logical parallelism between
the two marriages and other respective taedae, which might
very well be represented as setting the respective countries on
flre, but such parallel being only between the meningen (em· Ι
blematiaed by their toreham, not between the men themselves,
not between the offspring of Hecuba and the offspring of Venus
(vannat ruerus sous nr rarus aaran), and all reference to
the famous dream and lamone prophecy being irrelevant, such
parallel, I say, would not have been poetieal. Our author was
therefore under the necessity of omitting either the torch ol
Hecuba in arder to be logical, or the torches cl the two mar·
riages in order to be poetiea13 or, in case he retained both, of
using the word toret in two different sennem and this is what,
