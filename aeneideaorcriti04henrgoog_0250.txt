and before you hed ever set your foot in Italy, and to visit whom
was your sole business in Gumae. And il yon hed been so dull
as not to understand these broad and repeated hints, how oould
you have shut your eyes against the olear and explioit evidenee
ufforded by that ενθουσιοζειν, that miraoulous transfiguration,
while you still stood outside the aava, and tha deors had not yet
opened Ρ When you saw her oountenanee ohange and her oolour
oome and go-when you saw her heir dishevel of iteelf, her ohest
heave and her heart swell with transport of passion-when her
stature enlarged, and her voioe was no longer that of a human
being, but ol the god who spoke by her lips-who did you think
she was, il not the Sibyl? Ahl hard, indeed, and stony ol
hesit, what miraole will eonvinee you, thie having failed? How

as the saying ie, master ol-the situation, and might do what he
liked ; and he did exaotly what he liked, what he ie so exoessively
fond ol doing (see Rem. on 6. 529)-iuetead oi telling you what
actually happened, he told y‘ou oiroumstanoes whioh made it
neeessary that it should so hoppen, and left you irae to oonolude
for yoursell that it did eotuelly so hoppen. Whioh oonolusion‚
if you are not able to draw or do not aare to draw for yourself,
then here am I and yondar is Servius as ready to help you and
explain everything to you es awerthe Sibyl herself was to ex·
plain everything to Aeneas—to taho you ογ the hand as she took
him by the hand, aud lead you through these “ loos senta situ,”
this almost “ profunda nox,” these at hest dimly moonlit rietes
of ο lenguage dead and gone now nearly these thousand years.
Content, you say, and let us g0; and thare is Soipio, as Mr.
Holdsworth told us, led ογ Autonoe to this salisame' Cuman
