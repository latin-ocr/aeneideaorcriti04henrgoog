tearion or stretohing ol the arms to the cars may be seen repre-
sented in a sculpture discovered in the· Acropolis of Athens, in¹
1852, and sketohed in J al’s Flottc de Odi-ar (Paris, 1861), page
229. Exactly similar to the stretching ol the arms 1ο the cars
is the stretohing oi the arms to embrace a loved person or object,
a similar intermediate‘ state between the reposo or total inac-
tivity of the arms and the active embraoe, as ovid, Met. 10. 53
(oi Orpheus stretehing out his arms to embrace Eurydice) :

‘¹ brachiaque haeredem, prendique et prendere captans,
nil nisi cedentes infelix arripit auras.'’
As we have here arms intentio, applied tc, so in the same
manner we say eyes intent, ia, applied to tas Aea. 7. 251:
“intentos volvens ooulos;'' Prudent. contra Syram. 2. 99 .·

sense ol a pair or pairs of horses drawing a chariot. It is the
horsea, not the actual yoking or harncesing‚ which are put to
their speed, and any notion at all oi the literal yoke or'iu gum
only confines and spoils what is clear, graphio, and elegant.

Paouroun ru mannas raunawr (vs. 147)-“ Iu manuni
may mean either as Forbiger thinks ‘ut varennas dent‚' or lite·
rally and physically over the bhwe they piae, which is the same
thing as saying over the horres.'' The former is, as I think,
certainly the meaning» The latter is a bad picture, and is oon·
firmed by no parallel, while rw vananni in the sense oi “ut
urrunnun dent''is a structure ol the very commonest‚ and af-
