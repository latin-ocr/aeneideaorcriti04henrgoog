neously‚ eeI think ; first, οοοοιιοο “ clamor” hed been a rather
strange term to epply to the exhortation of Turnue3 eecondly, be-
cause oocupying the first, ie, the emphatic place, in the line and
sentence, it must mean the shout not ol Turnus hut of Turnus’s
whole party responding to his eall. Thirdly, heosuse Turnus’s
' party receiving the words of their leader witha shout and fol·
lowing him resumo nonmsouo, ellords a better picture than
Turnus’s perty receiving the shout ol their leader and following
verume noeursowo. In other words, the shout is not required
for Turnus, but is required for Turnus’s party. And fourthly‚
because-although excipere is used without an instrument in
the ablativo, in the ease of a conversation between two, ss vs. 258,
“excipit Ascanius,'’ in which cese the instrument in the abla-¹
tive, te, is easily supplied from the general sense-excipere re·
quires the expression ol the instrument in cases in which, as in the
present instance, the instrument dces not immediately suggest
itsell to the reader. Compare 5. 575: ‘⁶ excipiunt plausu perii
dos ;” 8. 124, “excepitque manu;'' 10. 867. “ exceptus tergo ;'’
ner. 3. 17, ‘exo'qiere insidiis.’'
