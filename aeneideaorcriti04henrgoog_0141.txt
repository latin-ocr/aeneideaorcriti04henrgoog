AENEIDEA [cemelenensis-uon.

“ principio eaelum ae tenus, camposque liquentes,
lucentemque globum lunae, Titaniaque astra,
spiritus iutru alit, totamque infusa perettus
ruens agitat molem, at magne se corpore miscet.
bine hominum pecudumque genus, vitaeque volantum,
atquae marmoreo fert menstra sub aequore pontu.'’

6. 292: ’

‘ et ni doeta eomes tenues sine eorpora ritae
admoneat volitare earu sub imagine formae,
irmat et frustra ferro diverberet umbras.’'

where Homer is represented not merely as having died in the
island of Ios, but as having leit his spirit there: “dying left his
spirit in me‚'’ and wbieh appears besides to have been the mean-
