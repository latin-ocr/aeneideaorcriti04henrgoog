not more so-whatever less so it may be-than the other inter-
pretatione vhioh have been offered. Whatever imagination is
in it is, besides, less mine than of the old Romam themselves and

typified. Acestes being of divine origin (verse 711: “divinae
stirpis Aeeetee''), vvas like Aeneae himself, Heroides, Julius
(laesas, and others of divine deseent, the more likely to be
oalled to heaven.
