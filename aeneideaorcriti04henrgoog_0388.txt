corripere spatium, corripere riam, ia never fo arzoibilate
space, but always to ariae, to take tte read, aa we aay in English,
with the additional notion, oontained in the oon, of taking it
vehemently, with foroe and powar3 in other worda, with the
additional notion of apeed. Compare ovid, niet. a. 156 (of tha
settin& out of tha horsea of the ann with Phaethon):

“ quae [repagula] postquam Tethye, fatorum ignara nopotis,
repulit, et fanto eat immensi eopia mundi,
aetram eam, pedibusque per aare motio,
obstantes findunt nebulae, pennisque lavati
praetereunt ortos iisdem do partibus Euroa,''

plainly an aooount of the taking of the read vehemently‚
spiritedly, with all foroe aad vigeat, not at all of annihilating
the apaoa; themora aspaeially aa the aooount ol the journey doea

ing it, whioh oooupy and form a very oonaiderable portion ola
pretty long poem. Comparing the other exemplar of the uae

of thia expression, the raader will, Ι think, be inolined to agrae
with me that the notion of annihilating apeoe ia wholly foreign
tait, and that it ia no more than rapiunt viam intensifled by
an intensive partiale. See Remm. on 2. 523 3. 561; 9. 375.
In the oeae before ua, eo far are Aeneae and the Sibyl from an·
nibilating apaoe, that even after they have performed the aot
deaoribed‚ after they have, aa alleged, annihilated the apeoe, they
have still not yet arrived, butaro only near arriving‚roa1ana
