thefluttsring of a single pigeom tied to the top oi a pole, to make
a wide uneovered spaoe, in whioh many thousands oi speetators
were collected, rosound? No, no; Servius is quite right; it is
inoredible (“ est ineradibile' ⁷). N or should Heyne have quoted
verse 215: “ planetamque exterrita pennis dat teoto oannem? as
parallel, the pigeon on that oooasion being not only under oover,
where its fluttering would be more heard and have more effect,
but being free to fly about, not oonfined to one spot.

(vv. 517-8) .—-There ean be no doubt that the seoond olause is
but the eomplement ol the first. Without the seoond elause,
it might possibly be supposed that the bird was no more than
wounded bytho arrow, and, unable any longer to fly, tell down
and was killed by the fall. For the eredit oi the aroher, it should
be plaoed beyond doubt that it was by the arrow, not by the fall,
the bird was killed, and the insuffioient nncrnrr axamurs is
eompleted by VITAMQUE sparnum rn asrnrs ssrnnnns. This,
as Ithink, the simple meaning ottho passage, is well illustrated
by Geory. 3. 546 .·

“ ipsis est aer aribus non aequus3 et illae
praecipites alta sitam aab nube relinquunt '⁹

[the very birds die in the sky (via, during a pestilenoe), and
fall down to the ground} Aeeording to' this interpretation,
⁸ · the vlTAM of our textis our English life (the “vitam'’ of the
just adduoed parallel, in whieh a plurality of birds is spoken of,
oan by no possibility be anything else), and the simple gist of
the passage: the bird dies where it is struok, viz, high up in the
air. Compare Eurip. Hel. 226 .·

οδε ror εν aha κυμασι τε astam βιοτον.

But let us not be too sure, nor dismiss the passage too sum-
man-ily. Not only other authors, but even Virgil himself else·
where, understand by vita not what we understand by our word
lasa, but what we understand by our word aoal; not a state or

manner ol being, but a seli-subsistent substantive being, ea. yn,
