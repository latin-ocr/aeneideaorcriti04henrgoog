'that his author should not talk nonsense (“ne tinnire inania

tion, “Gyri and volumina are probably the same,” shows
rather that he peroeived than that he applied his mind to solve
the diffioulty. Les us see if what our author has auidis not
both explioit and graphio; whether he does not desoribe the
serpent es making seven oirouits not merely round but on the
tumulus, ooiling himself all the time as he goes. In order to
arriveat this pieture, we have only to understand orsos as

auur as signifying the ooils whioh the serpent makes upon itself
during its motion forwerda, and swrnsxus the embraoe whioh
the serpent gives the tumulus, via, by being aetually on it while
it goes round it. I find 10 instanoe oi gyrus used in any
· other 00100 than that oi the oireuit 01 sweep whioh a mering
body makes when it deviates from the straight onward line, and
turns round about more 01 1000 in the direotion of the point from
whioh it has set out. On the other hand, I find 10 instanoe ol
volumen used in the sense of gyrus, or in any other sense
than that of a body either ooiling 01 ooiled upon itself. Am·
plexus always means embraoing 01 encompaesing in suoha
manner as to be at the same time in aetual oontaot. Auraaxra
then eompletes the notion expreseed by 011100, informing us
that the serpent was aetually on the tumulus while it made its
gyratione round it, and vorurrrra explains that the serpent dur·
ing its gyratione was not extended to its entire length, but went
along ooiling itseli or ourling as it went. Sarrsar informs us
that the gyratione made by the serpent were seven in number,
and 01111111 that the ooils whioh the serpent made in 010 gyra·
tion were repeated seven times, there being seven gyratione.
