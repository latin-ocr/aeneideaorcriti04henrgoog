thirteen lines devoted to the personality ol Aventinus, and no
more than two to his troops, these two informing us indeed that
they fought with “ pila'’ and ‘⁶ dolones '' and the ‘⁴ veru Sabel-
lum,'' but not saying one word either ol their numbers, or from
what part of Italy they oame; nay, so oontemptuously are his
troops treated that they are introduced to us with the word
¹ ‘⁶ gerunt'’ to whieh we are lelt at liberty to supply what nomi·
native we like. In like manner, we have eight lines devoted to
the two brother ohieitains Catillus and Coras, bnt not one single
word ol the troops under their sommand. Then while there

are five lines given to Lausus and two to Mezentius, the troops
of Lausus are despatehed in a single line, and those of Mezen-
tius in the single word “ agmina.'’ Umbro has ten lines and
shall to himself3 to Umbro’s troops not even so muoh as one
single word. Virbius has no less than twenty-two lines, but,

lor aught we are told to the eontrary, may be supposed to have

the aeeount oi the Greoian armamsnt given by Homer, in whioh
the first and most important plaoe is given to the fomes led, and
only the seoond plaoe and minor eonsequenes to the leaders,
Homer mentioning separately and individuelly every town,
oity, and distriot from whieh troops were sent to the war, with
suoh distinotness that a geographioal map ol Greeoe might he
formed from his eatalogue, and never growing weary, however
weery his readers, ol one unveried οι τε, οι τε, οι τε, οι τε, re·
posted without end. It would be in the very highest degree
tedious to go through the particular enses one after another, so
I shall sentent myseli with taking the first ease, via, that of
the Boeotians, Βοιωτων, for with the true spirit ol a demooret
Homer plaoes the peeple first, and leta the leaders follow. The
Boeotians, he tells us, were led by Penelens, Leitus, Aroesilaus,
Prothodnor, and Olenius, on not one of whom does he bestowa
seoond word, but hurries on to tell you with the most minute
circumstantiality the names of the individual towns, sities and
