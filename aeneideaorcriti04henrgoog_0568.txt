Vomano—omenta

Vonvmon amnem sonno (vs. 350).-“ Sine morsu, sine
sensu,'' Servius. “Sine morsn,’' Oynth. Oenet. “ Wie Ovid,
‘neo vnlnere membris ulla ierunt‚'' Thiel. “Drehet sie ohne
beriihmng einher,'’ Voss.

“ ei primaments infra la genna, e'l petto
strisoiando, e non mordendo.” (Caro.)

With the single exception of Servius's tw0 words “ sine sensu,''
thiais all in a high degme inoorreot. The meaning is, so ior
from being does aot otte (a meaning whioh it is diffioult to say
how oommentators have been able to find in the words at all),
that itis not even (a meaning whioh might have been legiti-
mately' dedneed from the words, oonsidored independently of
the oontext) does not loavia does not ooms into contest, olipa be·
tweea aa dress aad tlte body wdtom toaobe'oy, without coming into
contest wita tae atter. This meaning, Isay, might be legiti-
mately assigned to the words themselves (as-naono nonno),
and would besides agree well with the immediately subsequent
rannlsoon subsannas, doesnel louet, and is aot yerosioed by laer.
But then how are we to understand

Il the snake does not touoh her at all, how is it possible for it to
form itseli into e neoklaoe round her nsok3 honis it possible
lor it to servs as a band for her hair3 how is it possible lor it to
glide over her limbs in every dinootiom slimy and slippery?
There is so downright an impossibility in all this, that amasso
sonno must have some other meaning than aot toaohiay her.
What other meaning, then? Why, simply not beloy felt to
toust tar, eonooyisy ao impressiore to her sense ‹yseelz'ay ‚· and this
may probably be the meaning oi Servins’s ‘⁶ sine sensu,'' added·
