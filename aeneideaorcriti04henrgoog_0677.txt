646 AENEID'EA [74-89 ooo—anassrr

the very same “ honos,’' the vo'ry same “ quocunque.'' If there
are no “ dona” in the casa ol Dido, it is only because “ dona”
were then out oi the question, Aeneas being then a shipwreoked
sailor-“ grates persolvere dignas non opis est nostrae.’'

Exta-This is the appropriate word ior the haulay (exire)
oi a spring out oi the ground. So Ouid, aret. 11. 140 (Bacchus
to Midas):

‘⁶ spumiferoqua tuum fonti, qua plurimus exit,
subde caput.”

Saurea Honora uno (cebbrodcria), (vs. 76), theme; saurus
onnnnaaaaaa nours, variation. See Rem. on rs. 74.

Ooaareaa unsaramma renovans aueraroa aooaaura (vs. 77).
-Cynthius Genetensis is here, a tare thing ior him, up in open
rebellion against his prophet and master. “ ‘ Cornigeri dicuntur
fluvii,’ ut inquit Maurus, ‘quod mugiant tanquam boves, vel
cornutas habeant ripas ad similitudinem cornuum,' quod non
placet, nam fluvii habent aornos, i. e. ramos.'' Ι own that I
am up too, but ii Ι am, it is not with Cynthius against Servius,
but it is against both grammarians aliha. The horna oi rivers
are Ithink mere emblems of their strength like the borna oi
Jupiter, of Moses, oi the Egyptian gods, citha visioned beasts
oi the prophet Daniel, and Hannah's born which “is exalted in
the Lord.’'

Ansrs o Traron, ar raorros roa neuras rrraans (va. 78) .—
“ Flauus novo aliquo omine et certiore signo,'’ Forbiger, Thiel,
Wagner (Pracat.). I think not 3 first, because such demand for
a second omen had been an insult to the deity, inasmuoh as
tantamount to a declaration that he could not trust the promise
adready received3 and secondly, because no second omen is given,
the appearance of the sow (vs. 81) being not a new omen, but
to all intents and purposes part and parcel oi the omen already
given. In the words oi our tart, Aeneas, instead oi asking for
a new omen, accepts that already vouohsaied. Itis as iihe said,
I thaat thee scr thy ocrea, ared bey llaec to mute it qood-Fratres,
not confirm it by oractter, but ly aa cwasuljllmeat.
