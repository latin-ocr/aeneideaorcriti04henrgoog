argumentis bad. Itis quite according to Virgil’s habit thus
to interpose a parenthetic description, and then to return to and
complete the prinoipal subject, or subject which he had in hand
when he so deviated. On such occasions, tce, it is usual for
him, as he has done in this instance, und very strikingly, too,
to return even in the interposed eooount to the mein point of
the principal description so that there may be no hiatus between
the last word or words oi the interposed passage, and the words
of the resumed description. In the present cose vouusrnn
noxum (the very subject itselt ot the main description) con-
cludes the parenthetio part, and is fresh in the mind of the
reader when, iu the words usur animos reseas, the author
returns to and takes up again the main description. The con-
nexionis scarcely less close and less plain thau itu relative or
persona] pronoun cui or ci had been placed as connecting link
between noxum and naar. With naar animos compare 9. 142:
