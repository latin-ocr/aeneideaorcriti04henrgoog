The meaning, therefore, is, not thot the words ere eddressed
to Euryalus in a low voioe, the enemy being so near theto
usual loudness oi tone might hove olarmed them, hut thot the
words ere addressed to Euryalus in the ordinary tone of voioe,
while the enemy were still out oi hearing, ond thet, having
uttored these words, Nisus said uo more, but prooeeded to work.
