144 AENEIDEA [545-602 er earm-aenne

tenus Aeneas celeri certare sagitta invitat,'’ rs. 485), there ie not
only no such conjunctior] 01 this contest to the preceding, butthe
disjunction plainly marks the contrast, the transition to some·
thing new, 01 0 totally different kind, or out of the regular order.
Thirdly, no reason cau be assigned why the message was sent to

Ascanius sacretly (ernau an aunam) aud before the terminatien ι
01 the arrow·ehooting (nornen currimns ursae), if it were not

that the assembly might be surprieed by the sudden and unex-
peoted appearance 01 0 new “ certamen '' at the very moment
they supposed the amusemente ef the day to be concluded.
Fourthly, the wonder of the assembly at the unexpeotsd eight
is actually expreseed by the word uranus (vs. 555). Fifthly,
it was ruual ior exhibitore 01 gemes thus to surprise the people
with something unexpected; compare Pliny, Pacey. 33 .· “quam
deinde in edendo [ecia. spectaculo] liberalitatem, quam iustitiam
exhibuit, omni affectione aut intactus, aut maior. Impetratum
est, quod postulabatur3 oblatum, quod non postulabatur. Institit

as once throughout thie whole description used the singulm
esttamen in the sense 01 ledi, while, on the contrary, he has
several times employed the plural “certamina''(rv.66, 114,
596) to signify ons single one 01 those conteste whose tout cn·
semble constituted the cadi. Secondly, tha words “misso certa·
mine '’ where they occur before (re. 286) are sufficiently proved
both by the adjunot “ hoc,'’ and by the context, to refer to the
immediately preceding “ certamen,'' via, that of the ehipraoe.
Thirdly, the interpretation of Heyne aud Wagner being adopted,
there must 01 naoessity have been an interval between the tarmi-
nation 01 the arrow·ehooting and the appearance 01 Ascanius and
the raoranuu souare in the cirorre3 and then the difficulty ariees,
