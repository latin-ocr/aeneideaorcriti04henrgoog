end even more; to which effect he pledges himself on the
instant, and in the very next line: ι’

crosone creua rurs mamers orrum oonrrrs.
usuque narr 1sru urus onnnrurx rennuere canosa
sorum omnam,

a pledge and promise, it will be observedto which Euryalus's
claim is not, as it ought not to be, his affection for his mother,
but his great desert in sacrificing, primarily, himself, and
secondarily, his mother, on the altar of the public wool,

(emanso crocu rurs rrcrsrrscs eurora oosrrrs).

Yet this line, so necessary to inform the reader ol the effect of

Euryalus’s address to Ascanius, so necessary to explain what it
was that struck the minds 'ol all hearers (Percussa unsre) to
such a degree, that they even wept (osunen chenruus), ond
most oi all Ascanius (curn ouras concana runos)r this lino,
ro pregnant of moral sentiment, is expunged by Peerlkamp.
And why? Because, in common with the other commentatore,
he neither understood the line, nor the bearing of the line, on
the passage. Hear himself: ‘⁴ Motus est aare ouuns Ascanius,
lacrimas fundit. Quis eum movit? Euryalus. Quare? Quia
tem pius erat erga matrem. Pietas eum movit, Imo ipsa
niueo rrnrerrs quam . . . suis oculis cernebat. Vides, si
Virgilius hunc versum lecisset, eum scrisse scripturum:

malmaeqm mlxv! eunom mamm niueo.

Quare credo huc esse translatum ex 10. 824.’' Virgilian
studente will, I think, not be very willing to expungo either
this or any other line of Virgil, at the instance of a critic who
doec not even know the meaning oi the very h'ne he has himsell
oomposed, “Maternae rrnrcrrs’' not only not meaning the
affection of Euryalussor his mother, but actually meaning the
very opposite, rin. the affection of his mother for Euryalus.
Compare ll. 340: “materna nobilitos'’ [the nobility os his
mother]; coro. 1. 28: “ materna myrto’' [the myrtle of his
mother]; ibid. 4. 849ε “maternas auree'' [the ears os his
motherl.
