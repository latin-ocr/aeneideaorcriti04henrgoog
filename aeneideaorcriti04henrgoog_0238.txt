Hoasnnnnnoon rnoeon sncnnra sravnnan (vs. lep-Tho
immediate juxtaposition ol rnoeun and sacnnra srsvnaan has

given risa to the strange notion that the eave of the Sibyl was
at some distance (greater or less, according to the precise idea
which each expositor hod ol the force ol the word saecun) from
the templs ol Apollo. Hence inextricable confusion in the views
which have been taken, and the accounts which hsve been given,
ol Aencas's visit to the Sibyl. The simple solution oi the whole
matter is, that Procne belongs, not to seesnra, but to ram,
the construction being: annuas rsrrr saecun (lar from, er more
properly, apert from those of his companions whose occupatione
have been just described) arens, curans cronno rasnsrunr,
sncanraoun merenas. A false understanding oi this word no
longer leading us astrey, we perosive at once (see above) that
the aurnum ol the Sibyl was not at any distance, greater or
less, from the temple of Apollo, but was a part ol it3 actually

“ deinde,” “ dividit,'' 1. 199, 201. Compare Sil. 7. 416:

“ tum magno perculso metu Nereia turba
attonitae propere refluunt ad limina nota
Teleboum medio serpunt qua regua profundo
pumiceaeque procul sedes,'’

where the structure is “ surgunt procul.'’ Our author has a
fancy, if Ι moy so say, lor separating Aeneas now and then
from his campaniens, and loves to set him ia solo before the
render. Compare 5. 774: “ ipse . . . stans procel in prora.'’
Annus aromo (vs. 9).-“ Contendit ad Apollinem, euius
templum situm in sublimi parte Cumarum ideo ipse Apollo
aures, ideo templum ancns,'' La Cerdo. “Ancns: erat tem-
plum in montium iugis: hinc Apollo aures, et rasnsmnr ora',
quatenus templum tuetur, et cum eo urbem,'' Heyne. No;
