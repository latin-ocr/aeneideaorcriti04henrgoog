Aooording to the theory of Ko'ne, Spraolee der Rtmtsetea
Epiker, p. 184, Virgil has used the present for the past time on
oooesions, not ol ohoioe, or for tho sake of a better expression,
but oompolled hythe exigenoies ol the metro. The theoryis

of Caedicus, although the asts deseribed by “rapit'' and
“aptat'' were aots past long ages before tha time in whioh
Virgil wrote. In other words, the presente made by Dido and
Caudinus and Ηλιος are made iu the presenoe ot the reader
with the same Euenos with whieh andious’s present is appro-
priated by Euryalus iu the presenee of the render. The reader
who has no objeotion to be transported baok in imagination to
the time of the appropriation by Euryalus need not make muoh
objeotion to being transported baok to the previous adventures
of the appropriated objeots.
