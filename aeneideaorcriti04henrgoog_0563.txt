ad poenas e scelestis exigendas speetant, sed ad rixas turbasque
domestioas; ‘feces funereae' ad eaedem inde ortem,’' Wagner,
ed. Heyn., following Donatus3 and so Wagner, 18613 also For-
biger and Thiel. Heyne is right, and the other four oommen·
tators wrong. Veneres* and rrcns are literal, the verbera
and isoes with whioh Furios are armed by all writers whether
ol prose or verse, the very “verbera'' and the very “isoes''
whioh we find this very Frny, in obedienee to these very oom-
mands‚ introduoing into the house of Turnus, vs. 451: “ verbe·
raque insonuit ;’' vs. 456:

“ sic effatasaoem iuveni coniecit, et atro
lumine fumantes fixit sub pectore taedae.”

01⁴ course both varenas and raons are typioal ol trouble and

“ verbm torta dabunt sonitum nexaeque oolubris

Wagner. “ Du, taueendnamige, kennest tausend lriinste des
leids,'’ Voss. 'l'his is not the meaning. The number oi Aleoto’s
names, whether great or small, isindifferent to J uno and the
business she hae in hand3 but it is not indifferent to J uno and
the business she has in hand that Aleeto is ekilled in a thousand

uranu (nocendi), unua noenum rarae. Nonum is equivalent
to genera or kinds, ior every genus, or kind haring a distinet
name, there were, oi oourse, as many kinds as there were names.

⁴* l'rarrus here means κομμοί, planctis, ‘beatingr of the bremt? aa in Ovid,
Her. 10. 38: ‘verbera eum verbis mixta tuere meia’ There are other plasea in
