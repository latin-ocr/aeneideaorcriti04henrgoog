terribilis: qnorum pedes pomi perone setoso talos adusque vin·
aiebantur; genua, arura, suraeque sine tegmine’' [the fore parts
of the legs (ia, the ieet) were shod up to the anoles with boots].

Vnsrrsm aaran rama—Our nearest oorresponding word to
vestigia, as here used, is perhaps steps. The meaning oi the
three words taken together thus becomes: the steps ol the foot,
or (the singular being used lor the plural) the steps oi the feet.

Pham—Singulas lor plural. Compare Eurip. Hr'pp. 1147 .·

rer αμφι heram τροχον
arrexere rods γυμναδος mov,

where rolris so far from signifying a single foot of ahorse,
and ιππου from signifying a single horse, that ιππου signifles
the whole four horsea oi the quadriga, and roda their whole
sixteen ieet.

Vnsnrom rann ansa sams-The steps oi the beginning of
the leg were white, i. a, the steps of the foot were white = the
steps oi all the ieet were white, τ’. a, all the leet were white, or
the horse stepped with four white feet. Ausonius (“ Descriptio
egredientis sponsae '’) tahes these words and (preserving their
form and even their position in the verse) applies them to a
bride issuing from her ohamber: “vestigia primi alba pedis.''
The meaning of both authors is the same: Ausonius's, that the

bride's ieet are white, ta, that she wears white shoes (eompare Ι
S. Hermas, Pastor, 1, risio 4. 2: “Et eeoe ooourrit mihi virgo
quaedam exornata tanquam de thalamo prodiens, tota in albis,
et oaloeomeatia albas oiroumdata''); virgus, that the horse’s ieet

are white, aa, in joolrey phrase, that he wears white stookings.
Compare Sil. Ital. 16. 347:

“ proximas, a primo distem quantum aequore sunna
occupat ipse loci tantum: sed proximus ibat
Astur Panohates, patrium frons alba nitebat
insigne, et patrio pes enanis mmor aldo,'’

where the meaning is, that all the four legs of the horse were
white. This Roman admiration ior a white oolour on the iore·
head and legs and ieet oi heroes seems to have had an eastern
origin [see hymn to the sun-god Savitri, translated by Meier
