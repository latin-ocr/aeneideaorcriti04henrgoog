Id. 2. 393 (of the Lemnian masssore) :

“ exoritur ncvns urbe dolor, planctusque per omnes
it facies antiqua domos ”).

(4), On account ol the life the verb of motion gives to the
picture. And (ὅ), because it isVirgil's habit to divide into
several coordinate sentences, esch with its own verb and sub·
ject, netto blend into one sentence by uniting with a single
verb several subjecta conpled together.

presented the appearance (innoc, likeaeac, image, picture) oi war.
Now, however, that the horsemen are seen going out of the city
to the war, this appearance (image or picture) of war becomes
greater, te, the idea ol war clesrer and more virid. 'Phe

Merme-The name of the god or person Mars, used ⁴to
express the department over which he presides, as Bacchus so

spoken of, 2. 369, is that of the thing doeth, not oi Mors her·

tirrraelf ia ia permiranda, but the cattle itsels ia ia perer hands ; also

Bellona ridente Ocres, humilisque novorum
seditio clamosa ducum, sed rora iuventus,
verus ductor adest, et vivida martio tenayo?

where the same figure is used, and “martis imago'’ is not the
image ol the god Mars, but the image of the thing war3 and
where it is not Stilicho who is the image ol Mars, bnt Stilicho,
and his army and their equipments, which give avivid'pi'otnre
of war3 in plain prose, are martial. Το make my meaning still
