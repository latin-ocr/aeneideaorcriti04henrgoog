might possibly interiere, oorresponds to Asoanius's rourum,
with this differsnoe only (a differenoe importent keeping with
the different ages of the persons and tho different ultimate

results), that Evander's tear is stmng, and his saith or hope
weak, while Asoanius's iear is weah, and· his saith or hope

strong3 and aooordingly, while Evander dwells with emphasis on
his fears, end is at last wholly overpowered, Asoanius soaroely
at all alludesto thom, end only in the single word rourum,

and dismisses the young men with oonfidenoe end joy, ‘⁴ Ge: I
trust the reoovery ol my parents to you; go end take with you

my (good) fortune, that (good) fortune without whieh every
enterprise is vain; and my faith and hope, that faith and hope
whioh Ι bove in the goodness and providenoe 01 the gods, and
whioh inspiro me with the feeling that you will suooeed.'’
This mixture 01 faitb or hope in the future, joined with isar,
belongs to alleges and all religione, and, I believe, 10 011
men. We find fatiam and fortuna joined by Evander, not only
on the above oited oooasion, but again, vs. 333, where he informs
Aeneas that it was not Fata only, but omnipotent Fortuna also,

whioh had placed himen the Tiber-

“ me pulsum patria, pelagique extrema sequentem
¹ Fortuna omnipotens at ineluctabile Fatum
his posuere locis ;'’

aud a little previously (vs. 127) Aeneas himself is brought, not
by Fato only, but by Fortuna, too, to this same Evander (“ oui
me Fortuna preeari,'' 810). Numerous other instanoes 01 the
same kind might be oited, il these were not sufficient to show
that this junctior 01 sessura and mnus, this junetion os mers
ohanoe with rational probability, is sanationed by the frequent,
though still more inoongruous junotion 01 mere ohanoe with
fixed inevitable late-a junotion in whioh, aiter all, there is no
ooutrsdiotion, because that whioh is fated and inevitable always
appears 10 him who is ignorant 01 the neeessary connexiones
events 10 be the work or result oi mere ohanee.
For the rmus 01 our text eompare 2. 162:

⁴‘ omnis apsa Danaum et coepti fiducia belli
Palladis auxiliis semper stetit.”
