assuming the offensive was tall Typhoeus himself a terror to
Hereules. Compare vs. 682, Agrippa represented on the Vul-
eanian shield ol Aeneas ‘⁶ arduus agmen agens,'' where, il
senous in our text ie spoken not of the tall figure auderent
attimde ol Typhoeus, but of the height atwhieh he holds his
arms above his head, ‘⁶ arduus '' must be spoken not ol the tall
figure and ereot attitude of Agrippa on the poop or quarter-
deok of his vessel giving orders to his soldius, but ol the height
at whioh those soldiera are oommauded or merahalled above his
head, quod absurdum. Asnaus, therefore, is spoken of the
height and altitude of Typhoeus, and the oomma removed by
Wagner should be replaoed, and so the elimax, rasa sereonas—
nnouus-neun senens—restored.

Arduus ie very eommonly used elsewhere by Vngfl to ex-
presserant attitude or tall statmo, or both together, eo. yr. 3.
619 (ol Polyphemnslz “ipse arduus, altaque pulsat sidera,’' the ‚
parallelism ol whioh passage with onr text11³sn mannans
naeuus is of the elosest kind, Polyphemus and Typhoeus both
being giunta3 ὅ. 479 (of Dares, also gigantio) ¹:

“ libravit dextra media inter aornua aestus,
arduus, ellraetoqnaillisitinossaaerabro‚”. Α ⁴

where “ arduus '' ia, as in onr text, loll aad erret, and, as in our
text, in the emphatio position, being at one and the sometime
plaoed first word in the verse, and referring to apreoeding subjeet,
and separated by a pause from the sequel. If Wagner informs
us as above, that ress arenosus, annuns, suun rannus need
not territy a breve man even although no Heroules (“ non est
quod quis terreat virum fortem arma tenens''), a greater than
even virgil himself thought otherwise 3· for what does Milton
say of the seoond, the imitated Typhoeus? (Pur. Losl. l. 985) ε

. . . “ on the other side Satan alarmad,
eollaoting all his might, dilared stood,

like Teneriff or Atlas unremoved;

hia stature reached the shy, and on his orest ¹
eat bonor plumed; nor wanted in his graap

what saamed both spear and ahield.’'
