736 AENEIDEA [oro-529 rer-roms

hort man in der luit den ton einer tuba, man sieht 'an einer
orhellten' stelle des himmela walion blinhen und hdrt sie
klirren. Man denhe, Venus trag jetat eben die riistung ihres
sohnes in den Olymp,’' Thial. “ Die bedeutung dor himmeler-
soheinung erkltrt, Aeneasdahin, dass die wellen, welohe sioh
am himmel aeigen, die von anoan gefertigte riistung sei,’'
Ladewig'fflratalotionortrift, 1853). Ι look upon the whole ol
this oommentstion as fundamentally errone'oua. If it is the
Vulsonian snit of armour oarried by Venus through the air
whioh makes this noise, suoh noise was never made by a snit of
armour before or sinos, nor ever will be made again, even in
the imagination oi a poet muoh less disoreet than Virgil. Even

trumpet? Who ever heard ol suoh a thing? the olasbing of
arms to seem to be the braying of a Tyrrhena trumpet! Is
not the reader reminded ol the blind man· whose idea of the
oolour soarlat was that it resembled the sound ol a trumpetP
But let this pass3 let tho elanging of the pianes ol a single suit
ol armour not only be oo lond that everything aronnd seemed
to be falling (nonan onwm vrss sarasan), and'but at tho
same time resemble the braying of a trumpet. Why don't the

arms arrivs? Whither is Venus oarrying them? To Aeneas?
Ι Νο; they disappear from his view, like a paper hite, or bolloon‚
or soaring segle, and he hears no more of them until aiter he
has left the eonrt ol Evander, despatohed part ol his foroes in
boats down the river, and, alter along and latiguing marah
with the rest, reaohed the enoampment of Tarohon. Is she
bearing them to Olympus (“in den Olymp'') P· For what
purpose? To exhibit them to the gods, and then bring them
