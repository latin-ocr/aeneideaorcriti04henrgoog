Ι therefore understand nraurnr aecus to be a variety of urrann
unns, a dwelling on the just-expresaed thought, as if Virgil

scept thee. This is the more probably the meaning on aeoount
of the exaot parallel of Ausonius, Mosell. 140 (of the Silurus) :

“ at quum tranquillos moliris in amne meatus,

et virides ripae, 18 caerula turba natantum,

te liquidae mirantur squae,''
where “virides ripee'' ere the green banks ol the Moselle,
“eaerula turba natantum'' the fishes of the Mosella, and “ li·
quidae aquae'’ the olear waters of the Moselle; exaetly as in our
text 88888 susurrus is the groves in the neighbourhood,

ol both to the two immediately preceding clauses of the sentenoes
’ 18 whioh they respectively belong. Iu this, as well 88 in the
similar prosopopoeiae, Bal. 10. 13, quoted above3 ibid. 1. 39:

. . . ‘⁴ ipsae te, Tityre, pinus,
ipsi 18 fontes, ipsa haee arbusta vocabant ;’'

118889. 18161 ε

. . . “ flerunt Rhodopeiae eroes,

our author follows the lead of Moschus, whose very words· seem
