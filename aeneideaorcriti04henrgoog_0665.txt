634 aurumne [le-46 nanu. -ιιιοιιιιιι

compara Ovid, Μιι. 15. 785 (of the omens preceding the οιιιιιι·

ιιιιιιοιι οι anser): Ι
“Ρίιιιιι q oq ιιοιιιιιιιι· ennae ·
lurida sollicitis praebebat ι nmina terris?

idid. rt. 768 .·
Δ “ qualis ubi oppositas nitidissime solis imago

evicit nubes, nulleque obstante reluxit ;” Ι
ιιι both which examples “imago” is applied to ιιιο sun in the
identioal sense in whieh itis applied ιιι our text ιο the moon,
vin, in the senseof stepo, form, οιιιιιιιιιι aspect. . This being so,
via, imago in the sense ofe slope, sorus, οιιιιιιιιι aspect [being
equally applieable to eun aud moon]‚it tlollows that our author
might equally well, so lar‘ ae ‘imago’ ’was eonoerned, have ιιιιι,
Iane repercussum out ιιιίιιιιιι“ omagium solta, and that ifhe was
decidedt not tosay ιο, butt tosay rather- . .

SOLBR interuenisse! nur nam aursslnaonsu LUMB,

hewse deoided not by any unfltness oi the expression imopine
ιοιιι, but, first, by the measure οι his verse, whieh allowed him ιι)
say sona anraaonssuu, and did not allow him to say ιιιο re·
percussum ; and, seoondly, by the eireumstanoe that the sun, being
more important than the moon, not only should have the preoe·
donee, but ιιοιιιιι better do without the ornaments ιιιιιιιιιι and
ιιιιιιιιιις in other words: sons, alone, first word ol the verso,
was a perient oounterpolse for ssnlsurss suenrus sunan,
whereas ιιιιιι alone, first word of the verse, had been over-
balended3and3iful may so say, eolipsed by radiantis insopita
solie. ‘⁶ Imago‚'' in the sense οιιοιιι, figure, stopo, isthue added
to “ luna '' at the end ol the verse, exaotly as the same word, in
the same sense, is added to Adrastus, 6. 479 ε

“ hie illi ooonrrit Tydeus, hie inclytus armis
Parthenopaeus et Adrasti pallentis imago ;''

and exaotly es “ forma '' and “ formae ’ἶ in the same sense aro

added at the end oi the respeotive verses to “ trioorpor umbra‚”
6. 286:

' “ Centauriinforibas stabulant, Scyllaeque biformes,

⁸ ’ et centumgeminus Briareus, ee bellua lernae
horrendum stridens, flammisque armeta Chimaera,

Gorgones, Harpyiaeque et forma trieorporis ιιιιιιι ,·”
