422 AENEIDEA [807-813 rar-nsanos

iussit,'' where the reading “ extendere ”is not only doubtful,

’ but, if aeoepted (via, in plaoe of ‘⁴ ostendere'’), ufforde no good

sense. But the expression vrnrurnra narnunnnn namra, al·
though good Latin, affords, it will be said, a sense almost, if not
quite, as weah as maruan nxrnunnnn mans. To be sure, if no
better sense oen be obtained ior it than spread ooe'a ylory wide by
brooa deado (“V1arurnr1 per faeta exerere ut multa strenue laeta
edas,'' Heyne3 ‘⁴ durob thot zu verbreiten die tugend‚’' Voss;
“to spread far and wide‚’' Foroell.) ; but unlessI greatly mis·
take, amuoh better meaning for the words suggests itself on a

comparison oi them with the parallel passage of Silius, 9. 373
(of Paullus Aemilius) :

“ is postquam frangi res, atque augescere vidit

exitium, ‘brevis hoo vitae quodeunque relictum

mandatumst ait, ‘nam virtus futile noman,

ni decori sat sint pariendo tempora leti?

dixit ; at in medios, qua dextera oonoita Poeni

limitem agit, vasto connixus turbine fertur,''
where the meaning oan only be: hooioy bat a saw momente to lisa,
let mo entend thore ammenta bytroee deeris, i.e., latmo hybrooa
deado, in tha ebert space os time I haoa to lire, entend my lisa, tlte
some of my life, beyond my lifa'a actual limita, into futore oyes.
That this is Paullus's meaning is plaood beyond doubt by his
immediately rushing into the midst of the enemy in order to do
, those breve deeds whioh should ooterrd his life, the fame oi his
life, detestatore ogas, and then die on the spot. Exaotly similar

is the meaning ol ‘⁴ lamam extendere faotis’' in that passage of
our author, lo. 467, whioh hunished Silius with his model: ’

. . , “breve et irreparabile tempus
omnibus ast vitae3 sed sarnam arwam samir
hoo virtutis opus‚'’
not merely artaud oree's soora far ond wide oberat oae’s saljand dacr-
iay oae’a lffe, but (as shown by the opposition between ‘⁴ breve

tempus vitae'' and “ extendere‚'’ and Sallust’s preoisely parallel
“Quoniam-vita ipsa qua fruimur brevis est, memoriam nost’
quarn maxume longam effioere,'' and Oioero's (do Seaeot. ed.

Lamb. p. 415, l. 48) “ Quum enim id [extremum tompus vitae]
advenit, tuno illud quod praeteriit effluxit; tantum romanet,
