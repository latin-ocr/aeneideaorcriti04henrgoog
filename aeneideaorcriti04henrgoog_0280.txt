Id. Arnon. 2. 3. 10:

“ sint tibi cum domina signa fironda tus.’'

And sc exactly in our text cunn amns manns, what standands
siey ccrrp, i.e.‚ achilles they leod, as explained in the immediately*
following words cuo nswnsan annosus, which thus become the
variation of the theme ausu smus ananus. See Rem. on 1. 550.
Sioua is not with Servius and Heync “auguria omina,'’ because
the birds themselves were the ‘¹ auguria,'' the “ omina ;’' being!
Venus's birds they were themselves the best omens Aeneas could
have, and, having seen the birds, all that he had now to do was
to walch well whithcr they would lead him: ³

because it was not the ieeding cf the birds which should have
been observed by Aeneas-it was indifferent tc him whether
they were ieeding or not-but simply cuo annonas insonum
seccndly, because a parrae alter resonares, first word in thelina,
*would have bestowed cn it an emphasis disproportioned to its,
importance (see Rem. 2. 247); thirdly‚ because we have, 1. 401,
“ reduces illi‚’' exactly correspondiug to snscsunss rnssn3 and
finally, because, as observed by Wagner, ansrnnrss joined to

first, because the good omen oi the leading oi the birds should
have a strong emphasis, and in order to have a strong emphasis:
it should be joined with the preceding verse and separated from
the succeeding words of its own verse by a pause3 secondly,
because we have in Manilius's “ulterius pascentes tendere gau-
dent’' an exact parallel to cuo mussan panosus rascnmss -·
