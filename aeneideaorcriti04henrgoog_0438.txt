Pity that Lcrd Byron wae not equel tc eustain this unusually
line image. The very next line spoils it all hy the confusion
which it makes between the real urn ci which it speaks and the
figurative urn of the lines immediately preceding:

‘⁴ The Scipice’ tcmb acumine nc aehee now;
the very repuleras lie tenautloee
oi their heroic dwellere: dcet thou flou,
old Tyber, through a marhle wildornees?
riso, with thy yellow werce, end munile her dieheee !”

otherwise the comperieou ci Rome, in her present desolate stete,
tc Niobe ie quite equul to Virgil’s comparieon ci her, in her
palmy state, tc Oyhele. His previous comparieon (stanaa 2 oi

⁴ the same canto) of Venice to the tumet-crcwned Cybele is one

ci a different kind:

“ She looks a eea Cybebe, fresh from ocean,
rising with her tiara ci proud towere
at airy distance with majestic motion,
aruler of the wetere and their powers ι
end euch she was :-her daughters had their dcivcre
lrom epoile oi nemone, and the cxhauetlces Eaet
pcured in her lap cll geme in eperlding ehcwers:
in purple wae ehe robed, and of hor leuet
monarche partook, and deemed their dignity increaecd ; '⁹

the resemblance in the cese ci this comperiscn being only be·
twcen the domes of Venice and the turret crcwn ci the goddess,
end not extending, ae in the case of Virgil's, tc the children ci
the goddess and the heroes, the offspring ol the city. Byrcn's
idea was horrowed, as he himself informans, from Sabellicus, dc
