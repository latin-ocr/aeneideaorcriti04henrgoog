Virgil has indeed occasionally thus used his epitheta and with
the happiest effect3 see Rem. en ‘⁶ deas supereminet omnes,''

l. 505. At other times, attempting to make such use of them,

added epithet has no force psculiarly adapted te the occasion,
andis a mere title of ordinary respect. This I imagine to be ’
the case ou the present occasion, tha identical term being con·
tinued on into Christian use, and existing atthis moment in the
Catholic Churoh, where it signifies ne 'mera than thet respect
which is due generally to seniore and pemeus of learning, merit,
and influencs.
