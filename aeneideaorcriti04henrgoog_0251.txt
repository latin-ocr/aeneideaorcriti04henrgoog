236 AENEIDEA [lt-36 TIBI-GLAUGI
Sibyl; Deiphobe waa ¹her Autonod, her mistress of the oere-

moniee, in the time ol Aeneae. Stay, good Mr. render, it’a not '

yon who are to teaoh me, but Ι you. That Antenoi of Silina
Italiona ia not the Sibyl'a miatreaa ol the oeremoniea—how oould
she, the Sibyl being at the time long dead, and reporto in Hadea?
-but aha ia the aueoeaaor and living representative oi the dead
Sibyl, diaoharging the name dutiae towards Phoebus and Trivia
aa had been diaeharged by her predeoeaeor, and showing to Soipio
the same oivilitiea her predeeeaaor had shown to Aeneae. Thur
the argument deduoible from Silius turne out to be all in my
favour, and point-blank against Meaara. Holdaworth and Spenoe,
andthere remeius only the argument from the name, aa if Virgil
were not aa good authority aa Pamaniaa what was the name ot
the Sibyl, or aa ifthe Sibyl might not have had more nemea
than one, just aeDido, another of our author'a heroinee, had two
names and Inlue no leae thau three.

If Ι do not ᾶίεοιωε the right of the Sibyl, aa a goddess, to
have an attendant, itia no leae beoanoe the alaime ol the Sibyl to
goddess-ahip itaelf reat wholly on the miaappropriation to har
oi the term “dea,'' applied by our author to Heoate at verae
258, than because the point at ieaue ia not whether the Sibyl
hae a right to have an attendant, but whether Virgil hae aoknow·

lodged her poemenion ol aueh a right.
