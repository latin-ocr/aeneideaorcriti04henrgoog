496 susumus [ruo-119 sse-ransom

Plaut. Aur. 696 (ed. Wagn.):
‘¹ ego rum ilo ra Philippus, olepidum diem ν’),

ln all whioh passages, as in our text, the demonstrative pro·
noun is used less in the strictly demonstrative than in the merely
definite sensej in other words, is used tor the purpose of supply·
ing the want, so keenly felt not only by every Latin soholar,
hut hy every writer of Latin, ol the definite estiole in the Latin
language. Aeoordingly, sro murras runa uouussu is not, with
Servius and those other oritioa whose opinions I have oited above,
tra s‘s what scas meast by thot Jupiter· sobo apale by the moatlr of
Celaeno, but, with Heyne (“ animis, ut ita faeerent, subiioiebat'')
