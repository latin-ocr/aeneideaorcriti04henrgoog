Nor is there in this use ol certus tc express the sure, oer- '

tain, unoquivccal manifestatiou ci a luminary above the horizon,
anything strange, anything discordant with the general force
and general applicaticn ci the term. 011 the contrary, any-
thing which hom being doubtful has become sure, and can no
longer be doubted, is properly called certus3 ior a remarkable
instance ol which, and strikingly similar tc the applicaticn
which we are discmsing, see ovid, niet. 2. 665, where the speech

pusculo, quod est dubia lux, nam creperum dubium significat,
quaeritur,'' Serv. ad Aac. t). 268. “ crepusculum sic fortasse
appellatum quod res incertae creperce dicuntur, idque tempus
