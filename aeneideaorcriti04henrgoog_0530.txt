pare Caes. Bell. Oia 1.- “Ipse iis operibus, qnae faeere insti·

festival they feasted sitting at one long table, not at several
smallerP Ireply‚ in order to indicate the simplieity ol the
ancient times (passas) when the distinction of rank was less
observed than in the times in whieb Virgil wrote3 and instead
ef the superiore dining apert, vand even the inferiora being
divided into sesesal messes, as in a modern university eem-
mons, all, high and low, young and old, men, women, end
ehildren, dined at the one long table, Paannnms sensis ; as Stat.

land, and even in the neblest heuses, the demeeties sat at the
same table with the iord and the lady, only below the salt ς and
Ibeve myself seen in Germany the master and mistress, theseus
and the daughters, the labourers of the farm'and the demesties,
