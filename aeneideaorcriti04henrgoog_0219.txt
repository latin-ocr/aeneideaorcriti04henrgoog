204 sanamus [sno-871 resinat-saras

untias them3 in other words, relieves them irem their office,
discharges them from their duty, lete them go ond rest. I
understand the word to be used in the same manner, 4. ὅδε

“ spemque dedit dubiae menti, solvitque pudorem ''

[loosed modesty, discharged modesty from her office, let modesty
go about her business} The metaphor is taken from the un-
yching oi oren after their day's work, as Geory. 2, art. aera:

“ et iem tempus equum fumantis solvero colln.”

The oxen, literally loosed or unyoked, are at liberty to take rest,
to go to sleep: the eyes, metaphorieally loosed‚ are discharged
from their office, exercise the same liberty ol going to sleep.
That this is the serrse oi the “ solvere'’ ol our text might be
inferred, if lrom nothing else, from the striking similarity oi the
expressions sarnam achran sonvrr and “ fumantia solvere
oolla''-both being expressions oi one and the same author.
V1x Parnes irrorans coins serarianas seros (vs.857).-
‘⁴ Prinos has really the force ol primurn, but itis also meant
to be taken oi those limbs or thet part oi them which were
first affected by sleep. We should say ‘sleep had scarcely
began tc relax his limbs,’ loohing at the process as separated
into parts, though the effect ol each part would extend equally
to the whole body. Virgil chocses to suppose one part ol
the body affected before another,’' Conington. Incorrectly,
unless we extend the same double meaning ol primus to
other similar instances ol the use ol the word, ea. yn, to ‘⁴ pri·
mam urbem,'' 6. 810; “ primas arces,'' 7. 61; “primas urbes,”
Sil. 13. 533. As this cannot well be done, and as besides the
doing so ufforde no advantage-on the contrary, confusos instead
oi clears up-I limit the force ol “ primus,'' in our text and the
parallel passages adduced, to the aot, and separate it from the

thing acted on; in other words, I segurd ‘⁴ primam,’' ramos,
and “primas'' in these passages as strictly equivalent to the

adverb primum, and not as at one and the same time equive-

lent to primum and retaining their adjectival laroc. See Rem.
