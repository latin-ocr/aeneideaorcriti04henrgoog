ol, for· he translates the words literally:

‘⁴ ob er den seh'dumenden ross' in die bug' einbohrts die spernen‚”

Forbig'er's solution of the diffioulty is more plausible: “ ‘Armi'
hie latiore sensu positi pro lateribus equi, quae ab armis inei·
piunt3 nam armi ipsi palearibus non fodiuntur,” whioh loose
use of armi would exaetly eorrespond with the use which we
have already seen made of ealx for the whole foot and of
peetus for the whole trunk from the neek to the pubes. Ι
think, however, that neither is this explanation the true one,
and that nanos is te be taken in the literel sense offoreqaarter‚
beoause we find the armi or forequarter described hy Horace,
aar. 1. 6. 104, as the precise seat ot' the horsemen r

. . . “nunernihieurto
ire lieet mulo vel si libet usque Tarentum,
mantica aui lumbos neure ulceret, etque eques armos‚’'

where “armi’' so explieitly opposed to “lumbi’' the loins or
hindquarter‚ oannot by possibility mean anything else than the
shoulders or forequarter. The armi being thus established as

the seat ol the rider, itis easy and natural to suppose that it
was the lower part ol the armi, thet part ol the forequnrter‚
whieh looks towards the ground and whioh was direetly under
or even in irunt of the nider, whieh was spurred by the horse-
men, not eneumbered in those aneient times with stirrups, nor
taught that it is graoelul and elegant to ride with the toes
turned inwards‚ or at least with the ioot parallel to the horse's
body, but sitting at ease, aud, as all untaught horsemen sit at
the present day, with the toas out and the heels in and the legs
thrown very much forwerd, exaotly as we see horsemen repre·
aented in the aneient mednls and statues, and as that horsemen
ol Corippus must have sat whose right foot was piereed by a

spear whieh, eutering at the near armus, had passed through
his horse’s body, «loiron. d. 758 .·

“ Guarsutiaeque levem coniecta comminus hasta
fundit equum. laevo tremuit confixa sub armo
fraxinus, et calido rurrens per viscera ferro
perque prdem dextrum domini conserta pependit ; ’⁹
