“ non comites, 'non ferre ipsae vestigia natae
aequa valant. Tantum miserae dolor ultimus addit

(where'again the use oi ‘⁴ emdeseere” confirma tha explanation
of crudus just given, tha sense being that sorrows stimulate tha
jaioes whioh oiroulale in the veina oi old age).

In what relation the other meaning oi orudus, via, row in

the sense of roro as applied to doeh, stands to the meaning just
explained is, I think, uncertain. Until further light is thrown
on the subject, we may as well assume that the primary mean·
ing ol the word ie raro, in the sense in which we use that word
when we say “ raw meat‚'' meaning unoooked butoher’s meat;
and that irom this primary sense flow the two other aeneas ol
the word-first, its oense oiyaioy, in whiah sense we have just
seen it used in our text3 and seoondly, its sense oi harah (ta,
not soltened either hythe ripening or by the eoolring praeese),
in whiah sense the term erudus is applied to eutting instru-
ments, on aaoount oi the disagreeable sensation they produoe in
eutting. Onr English word raro is a very exaot equivalent for
the Latin aradus, being at one and the same time the very
term by whiah we commonly express unoooked buteher’a meat
and the harah air of a wintry day. We never indeed apply
the term to the juioiness oi a vigorons old age, but ea reoanohe
we apply it to the juioiness oi youth not matured, soitenod, or
eooked by time. See Rem. on “ aradum ensem‚'' 10. 682.
