498 AENEIDEA [110-119sre-rnrssrr

Partly on aeoount of the little oooasion there seems here for
an adjunet so strongly emphatic es rrss, partly on aooount of
the remarkable analogy of lo. 875 and Sil. 3. 181, both quoted
above, and partly beeause a substitution of rrsr for 1111 was a
natural lruit of the false interpretation put, from the earliest
times (as Donatus: “Iupiter qui illis futuram famem per
Arpyiam nunciaverat ”3 Serv. od loo. “qui per Harpyiam
vatieiuatus est'l), on the reading ruta, I have ventured to leave
in this instance, as Ι have left in some few others, the path of
the manuscripts, and, following in that of the elder grammarians,
read not rrsn, but lere.

uxrem canneru, oneror rursus enum, and raruurs
QUADRIS, are all only varieties of expression for one and the
sem'e thing, vin, the roenna mne of verse 109, already at verse
111 varied into cunum sorum while again wne rapereris a
variety for vronsnu 'narn usnrsoun tonsorare, whieh in its
turn is a variety for venturus noasuS, or using that illustra·
tion from the art of musio, whioh Ι have so often found nseful
before, vuarrnr uorsus uxrsuau 1w canneru is the theme, and
v1orsnu risun usnrsoun auneeruus oannis rsrrnrs oausrr is
thefirst,and1>srun1s wne ranonnn noenius the seoond, varie·
tion. Suoh riohness of expression, very eommon in Virgil, is
hardly, so far as I know, to be found in any other writer. See
Remm. on 1. 23 ; 72 15.

Osann, rarunrs, euenere-It would appear from henes
that the Trojan leaves were broad, flat and round, like our own
griddle breed, the Ssoteh oeten sake, or the modern Egyptian
bread desoribsd by Whately, Rsyyed Lsfe ia Egypt, p. 202:
“ The native Egyptian broad is a sort of dap, pliant and moist,
like a oold panouk03 itis always round, and of a dusky oolour,
and, in fast, resembles the flat stenes often found in the bed of

rivers, or in the desert. At a distanoe, e pile of bread might be
taken for a pile of suob stones.''

Quaeris-Quadra is one quadrant or quarter of a round
flat aske out into four by two diameters at right angles to
eaoh other. It is therefore presisely the Seottish sorte (Teut.
