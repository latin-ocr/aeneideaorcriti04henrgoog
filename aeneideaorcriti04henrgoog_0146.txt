the prodigy should therefore refer to Aoeatea Aa if to plaoe
¹the matter beyond doubt that the prodigy does actually refer to
Aoeataa, we have it referred to him by no 1111 an authority than
the express worda of Aeneae himself ε

Bm, PATER, m 'H roton· REX MAGNUS oman
rmus avertens molam noem nouom.

In the faoa of thia declaration, to refer the omen either, with
La (larda and Voss, to the burning ol Aeneaa’s ahipa by the
Trajan women, or, with Heyne, to the wara of the Romans in
Sicily, or, with Wagner (ed. Heyn.), to the war between the
Trojano and Rutuliana, or with Wagner (Proaat.) to the Julian
sidua, isto give the lie to Aeneas and make him stultify him·
1111. Add to thia that Siliua'a imitated prodigy, 16. 580 (via,
the taking root oi Soipio'a jevelin in the ground and shooting

Aoeetaa, not to matters with whioh Aoestaa hae nothing whatao·

the seat of the goda and deified heroes, and ultimate goal ot the
hero'a aspiratione while “ inter mortales degena,'’ or, 11 we aay,
,in the fleah. The arrow 11 ahot takes lire and disappeara, but
not without marking a fiery path (arauavrroua vrau ranarum).
