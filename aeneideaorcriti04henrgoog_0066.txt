we arrivs at onae at the true meaning 11 1 passage whioh like
our textis wholly unintelligible eo long as “ olim '³ is under·
stood to mean formerly. The eave 11 Proteus opens on a bay
into whioh 1 great sea rolla, se. from the offing, when the wind
blows direot into the hay, “quo plurima vento eogitur . . .ιιιιι11,”
but whiah “olim'' 1111111 (1111· tiores), via, when the wind blows
from either side (the hay being formed by mountainous projeo· “
tiens on either side: “exesi latere in montis'’), makes 1 good
roadstead in whioh ships may shelter from the violenoe ol suah
winda. Thus in the passage in the Georgia there are two dif-
ferant times or sessons spoken 11, in one ol whioh‚ referred to
by “olim'‘ the bay is, and in the other of whiah the hay is not
a sale shelter for ships, exaatly as in our text there are two
times or seasons spoken ol, in one of whioh (referred to by
onm)t the roak does, and ιιι the ot ther 11 whioh the rook does not
afford a proper goel for a regatta.
