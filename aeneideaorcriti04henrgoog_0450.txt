Lamnus URBEM inanima—Compare Plin. Paneq· dt:
“Provida severitate oavisti, ne suadeta lepidus deitas eversa
legibus videretur.'' ‘

Pennana—Not will found (fundamenta meabit) but will
make stabla, or firm aad secere. Compare 6. 3: “ dente tenaoi
aneora fundabat naves,'' where “dente tenaoi'' eoi-responde to
the anelans of our text, “anema'’ to Numa, and “ navsa” to
ennam, “fundare'' being eommon to both sentenees. Compare
also the just quoted passage of Silius: “primas fundarunt
moenibus mbos,'' differing inem theVirgil sentenoe only in one
word, and meaning not founded oa or with fortificatione, but made
fast, firm aad secere withfortifioationa. 1

Onnmna naevis nn nannnnn nnana inssns ne mnemon
maenum-Who had ever gueased, cipriani, that words so p'eou'·
liarly and properly ,applioable to Numa Pompilius were one
day to be applied (little altered) to a oharaeter almost in every
respeet tho point-blank opposite of the priest of Onnes? Yet
so they have been applied by Virgil's often happy, sometimes
happiest, imitator, in his imitated aeoount of the spirits prs-
pared in the underworld for return to the uppei, Sil. 13. 863
(ed. Rup.): ·

‘¹ hie Masius <neo multa dias ism restat ituro
aetheream in lucem) veniat tibi oripina parea ’ · ’
