294 AENEIDEA [aee-304 our-snunoros

Luuuua sehunna, exaotly as in Frenoh, “yeux de flamme,'’
and “oeil ds flamme.'' Compare Apollodor. Bitl. 1. 6 (of ’
Typhonlz Πυρ δε εδερκετο τοις ομμασι.

Dante, reading unauna, and, as usual with him, misunder-
standing his master’s meaning, represents the eyes oi Charon as
standing in the midst of flama, surrounded with oiroles oi fleme,
Inserao, 3. 99 .·

“ ohe ’ntorno agli ooohi αἵθ di flamme ruota’'

Sermone-Literni, dirty. So Ovid, Met. 2. 29: “Autumnus
caleatis sordidus uvis.''

Soanrnus nx Humanis sono nurnunar aurosus—Ii the
expression had been Huunms nnrnunnr aurosus, or ot uuun-
ars narnunnr suroruS, the meaning would have been that the
dress covered, and hung down hom, the shoulder, where it was
lastened, nono, by a knot. Compare l. 730: ‘⁶ dependent lyohni
laquearibus aureis;'' Suet. Galo. 11: “dependente a eervioibus
pugione ante peetus.'' But, first, ii suoh had been the fashion
oi Charon's dress there had been no ooeesion to mention it, suoh
fashion being the ordinary one and presumable by the reader3
and seoondly‚ the expressionis neither simply numurus nor ab
nunnius, but rr aurursus, an expression signitying‚ as Ι have
shown, Rem. on 4. 263, not from tae shoulders, but off tho
elevatiora, or from off tlte shoulders, We are therefore to pio·
ture to ourselves Charon's dress as leaving the shoulders, or at
least oneshoulder(loruuunn1s does not neeessarily signiiy both
shoulders) bare, therefore pretty mueh oi that kind ealled hythe
Greeks εξωμις. See Rem. on “ demissa ex humeris,'’ 4. 263, and
eompare Plaut. Mar Clau. 4. ly. hi:

⁶· lecito nt venias ornatus huo ornatu nauelerioo.
osusiarn habeas ferrugineam, orrloitam ob oeulos laneam3
palliolum habeas ferrugineum, nam is eolor musaeum
id woeserma iu lruuwro horo, expapillato ὸνασΙιίυς
praecinctus uliqui; assimulato quusi gubernator sies.''

Nono—The knot, i. a, the string or other iastening whioh

ι going ouer¹ the shoulder, perhaps somewhat in the form oia
modern suspendor, supported the dress while it leit the arm
