TROIANOS-PUPPES

Taomuos (vs. 688).-Emphatie; see Item. on 2. 247.

Praras surmus (vs. 688).-Compare Psalle 89. 48 (LXX.):
τα elsa σου τα appara, “Thy old leving-kindnesses''-very aptly
quoted by Conington. How is it possible that pietas (aserib-¹
able even to Jupiter himself, and signifying hie morey, his hind-
ness of heart, his pitia, for mankind) same ever to be eonfounded
with pieta, piety, a feeling wholly unasoribable to Jupiter? See
Rem. on “insignem pietate virum,'’ 1. 14.

Nunc (vs. 690).—Very emphatic: azoer more tlon at orry other
time5 trote, if eser. See Rem. on 2. 247.

Quor) surnansr (vs. eall—‘⁶ Rebus omnibus arnissis alasse
amissa, nihil supererat, quam ut moreretur,” Heyne, Wagner
(ed. Heyn.), eomparing 12. 643: “id rebus defuit unum ;'’
audeo perhaps we are to understand Servius’s so briei as
seareely to be intelligible “ quod oongrue sequitur.'’ This,
. too, is the meaning I find in the passage, in preference to that
assigned to it by J ahn and Conington, and as Ι think deservedly
eundemned by Heyne: ‘⁴ ouon suranasr e rebus Troianorum'’
-a meaning against whiah I am bold enough to rite the very
parallel, verse 796 below (where see Rem), whieh Conington
enlists on behalf of his opposite interpretation.

Taurasras suan noan enarr (ve. eecli-Sma nona, “ ama
exemplo,’' Servius. ‘⁴ Immodiee,'' Heyne, Wagner. Servius is
. entirely wrong, Heyne and Wagner so iar right that “immo-
dice'' is the ultimate sense, the poetry being omitted or not per·
eeived. The immediate meaning (the metaphor being preserved)
is without nmrrners, rnsstlsout deoseey, therefore aadelp, rootlessly,
outroqeoualy. Compare 7. emtor Amata):

“ immensam siae more furit lymphata per urbem ;’'
