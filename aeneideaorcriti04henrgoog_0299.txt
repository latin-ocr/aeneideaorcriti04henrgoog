is“ maligna'' (scanty) because it is the light of a“luna incerta‚’'
or of a moon dimly shining through ahane. The two sentences
throwninto one would read thus: sun nameus nucn incertae
Irenae.

Maruows, scanty, as in Greek, αφθονος, copiosus, and
αφθονια, copia. Compare Xenoph. Oyrop. 1 (ed. Hutoh, p.
23) : repetam πολλην optavere.

[Aliter] Iwosnran nuwsn.—“ Incurrunt alii mensumn
legunt; illuc tamen recurrit. Nam incertum irrepentem, ie.
orinatum, significat,'' Servius. “ lwcaarsu, nubilo oaelo,’' Hayne,
Wagner (Pr-orat„ comparing “incertos caeca caligine soles,’'
3. 203), Forbiger. I dissent from both interpretatione dortho
same reasons-first, because darkness such aethere is in a wood,
at night, either when the moon is very young, or obscured by
clouds, had been so little short of utter darkness as not tc have
allowed the view oi obj acts which Aeneas is described as having
enjoyed. Secondly, because it is not according to Virgil’s
manner to descend to such minutiae, vin, to inform us that the
light by which Aeneas walksd resembled moonlight in a wood
when (with Servius) the moon was young, or when (with Heyne,
Forbiger, and Wagner) it was elouded. Thirdly, because it -
behoved Virgil to say which kind oi uncertain mooulight ha
meant, whether thet arising from the youth and consequent
small siae of the moon, or from clouds, as he has explained
the dim sunlight, 3. 203 : “incertos caeca caligine soles.'' I
think, therefore, that there is no other uncertainty ol moonlight
meant in our text than that which is produced hythe woods
themselves. The moon is uncertain (lucarnam nonan), and
the light is scanty (auca untione), bacaiuse asr msa rw srnv1s.
Thus we have-(o) a sentence eomposed according to Virgil’s
usual manner, vin, of affordiug you in the latter part of the
passage or sentence a hey wherewith to unloek the meaning
shut up in the first part; and (t) the light is not reduced to so
infinitesimal a quantity aa to be by no possibility of more use
to Aeneas than the homoeopathist's millesimal grain of aconite
