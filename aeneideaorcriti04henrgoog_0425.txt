ing is, that all the purified souls aiter a thousand years' residenoe
iu Elysium are aliha brought down to Lethe and aliha recsoend
to earth, and the uss ouuns arc those of them who at the time
ol Aeneas's visit had already uudergone their thousand years of
preparation and were then ready ior the resecent. In nothing is
our author’s admirable tact more conspicuous than in the manner
in which the whole accountis calculated to flatter Roman vanity,
and especially the vanity oi Augustus. The special attention ci
Aeneas ia attracted by the concoctae and bustle on tha banks oi
Lethe. To his inquiry concerning it, Anchises answers that this
was the very thing hc had been so anxious to show and explain
' to his son: that those were the souls oi tho blest, preparing to
ascend to earth and become his Roman postority3 that yonder
was Silvius the Alban king, youder Procas, yonder Capys,

and Gabii and Fidenae aud Collatium3 there Romulus, the scu

restoration of the spiritual part to its primitive purity, ia hut
subsidiary-an explanation necessary to satisly Aeneas and, of
course, the reader, how it happened that souls having had ex-
perienoe of the wretchedness oi this liis should yet desire to

return to it even from Elysium:
