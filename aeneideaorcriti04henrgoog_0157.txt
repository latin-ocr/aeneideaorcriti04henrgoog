formers, no less than the spectators, it was a real lodus, Compare
Manil. 4. 227:

“ eunt, quibus et sinmlacre placent ot lodus in armis,
(tantus amor pugnae eat), discuntque per otia bellum.''

With the greatest propriety, therefore, and attention to oonfrast,
was the Ledus Prosae placed attha end of all the other games3
in which position, like the afterpieoe of our theatre, it tended by
its gaiety, liveliness, aad innocense, to obliterate any painful
impressione which the more serious character of the preceding
pisces might have left upon the mind, and to put all parties
concerned‚ whether actors or spectatore, in harmony and good
humour with themselves aud with eooh other. Further still3
this concluding geme, beautiful in itself‚ beautiful in its novelty,
unexpeoted exhibifion, and contrast, had besides a peculiar beauty

he had reinstituted the ancient, hereditary geme, perfect in every
the most minute point and particular, as it could not fail to bs,
the poet having, with the art of a prophet prophesying after the
event, formed the plan and drawn the picture of the ancient
gama on the model of the reinatituted one.

With Virgil's description of the Ludos Troico compare the
account given by Apuleius (Met. 10. 29) of the Pyrrhia danae:
“Puelli puellaeque virenti florentes aetatula, forma conspicui,
veste nitidi, incessu gestuosi, Graecanicam saltantes Pyrrhicam,
