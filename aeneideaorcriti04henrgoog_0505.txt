of vvhioh passage the sona of our text represents both the μιαν
and the orna, inasmueh as she who vvas the sole olrild was of
nenessity the erre aole ehild. The text oonsists ol theme and
variation, the variation eonveying so munh more information
than usual, as almost to hare the effert ofa theme, inasmuoh

Conington's erniahle expedient, vin, of interpreting nunna “ no

being rather to emasculate, to deprive nunna of at least one-half
its strength and energy, than to reeonoile it with oureus narina,
or make the absence of ium or some sneh defining explanatory
partiale less sensihly felt. Nunti, awkward and inconvenient
