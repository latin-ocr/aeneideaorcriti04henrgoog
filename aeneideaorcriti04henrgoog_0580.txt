1155511515 is no eontrast or opposition between 11555 51511511
1111155 Annus 5511511, understood to mean 115 more of tlte city
55115155 theo its rueme, and roardus 5515. 05 5115 contrary, the
two sentences, if immediately oonneoted with eeoh other, should
have been united not by sno, but by ot or nom. No more of 555
city reviruisse than its mere rioms, for (or aad) sa sortasse 555555.
1555155515 oonneot 55115551 surr with nouus 15551 5555111111
5151551515, and eonsider the werde nr 51155 usurum 111555
arnas 555511 to be thrown in parenthetioally‘: 555 ploce was of
old time called Ardea (51555 great nome continues down to 5115515-
5555 day) ees desertans ispost. I think, too, that it 1155 11555
1551151 gratuitously assumed that the words 11555 ussurus
1111155 runnu 1151155 mean that the eity had entirely disap-
peared, leaving only its name behind (“nuno nihil superest
praeter nemen‚'' Heyne). This may be, but is not necessarily,
the sense. The words will equally bear 51151555 strong mean·
ing: tue oityss no longer 51155 it war, 55 longer desereire of its
preat nome. J 1155 55 ws might say, speaking of Rome, et 51515
monum maaet 155515 nomen, without meaning, however, that
there was at present no suoh eity 55 Rome, nothing remaining
of the great oity ol Rome but the mere name; and just as Oieero
(51 Vara, 5552, lib. 5, 5. 72, ed. Orelli), speaking of the plunder
hy Verres of the temple of the Idaean mother, says: “ teque,
sanctissima mater Idaea, quam apud Enguinos, augustissimo et
mligiosissimo intemplo, sio spoliatam reliquit, ut nuno 11511155

without meaning 51155 5115 temple had eeased to 5111551155111511
