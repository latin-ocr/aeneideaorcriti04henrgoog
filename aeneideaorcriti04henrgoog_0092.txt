taken into aooount) has eontributed more to the advanoement ot
elassioul literature in Europe than perhaps any man that ever
lived. The errore of suoh a man (and who may hope to disouss
without error the meaning ol almost every word of Virgil t) are
at least deserving of lenity. Servius, the third oi the sommen-
tators of whom I have here been led to speak, derives from the

aoeident of his having lived so muoh nearer to the time of
Virgil a double advantage over the other two: via, a vemaoular
knowledge oi the language, and aooess to souroes of information
respeoting Virgil whioh have sinos been lost. Notwithstanding
these two great advantages‚ Servius (or whoever else may have
been the author of the commentarios aseribed to Servius) was,
owing to defeets in himself, infinitely inferior as a oommentator
of Virgil, heth to Voss and Heyne. Totelly destitute oi poeti-
eal sentiment, and stone-blind to Virgil’s fasoinating graue and
eleganoe, Servius sees nothing in the Aeneid but a mere matter
of laet narrative, suoh as might have oome from the pen of an'
Aratus or an Avienus, and writes oomments on it whioh bear
the same relation to those of Heyne and Voss as we may sup*
pose oritiques upon the mamas of Shekespeare‚ written some two
hundred years ago hythe master of a village grammar sohool in
Yorkshire, would hear to those of Sohlegel.
