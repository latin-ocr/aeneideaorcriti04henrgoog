her son, the splendid ohlamys whioh she had been working as
o present for him. Compare Aea. 11. 72 .·

“ tum geminas vestes auroque ostroque rigentis
extulit Aeneas, quas illi laeta laborum
ipsa auis quondam manibus Sidonia Dido
feoerst et tenui telas dinumerat auro.
harum unam iuraui supremum maestus honorem
induit, arsurasque eomas obnubit amiotu.”

Even where there were no wounds to be hid from view, aud
the body not disligsned at all, it was not unusual, for the sake of
greater honour, to dress it out in a splendid germont, either the
deoeased’s own when alive, or presented by some friend or rela-
tive ior the purpose. Of. Epigr. Meleagri, Arato. Pal. 7. 468 .·

where it is doubtful whether the sense is: that Oharixenus
having died soon after he had oome to the age of eighteen‚ and
put on the ohlamys, his dead body was dressed out in that
ohlamys whioh he had so lately put on3 or that Charixeuus,
having died just when he arrived at eighteen years oi age, his
dead body was wrapped in the chlamys whioh hud been pre·
pared for being put on by him, but whioh his promoturo death
had prevented him from putting on. The famous web of
Penelope seems to have been a similar ohlamys, but whether at
first intended as a present for Ulysses on his saie return, and
only when his return alive was despaired of turned to the
purpose oi a sepulchral dress, ταφηίον, or whether intended
from the first as a ταφηιου pupae does not appear with sufficient
distinotness. Compare Hom. od. 2. 96 .·
