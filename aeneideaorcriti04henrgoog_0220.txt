nnrns and all his eomredes and Aeneas himself were so anxious
to live the remninder oi their days, and there lay their bodies ;
and was it not on this very shore, this shore ol Great Hesperia,
thet in the beginning ol the sevanth book Caieta is oongratu·
lated as having died? Either therefore our author is inoonsis·
tent with himself, or renova annun does not mean soroiyn atone,
ostona unknown to Palinurus, but unknown saneah renone being
applied to the sand, not beoause it was the nand oi Italy, ta, ol
a nountry unknown to Palinurus, but because all sand is un·
’ known, ta, not visited, unfrequented, and where the dead body

may lie nnseen and without anyone knowing it is there. Ex·
aotly similer is the nse oi ignotus, 11. 865:

‘⁴ illum expirantem sooii atqua extrema gementem
obliti innato camporum iu pulum linquunt,”

where “ ignoto '' oannot well mean other than unknown to eoem·
one, undiste'nynisted, senatorial ; and where “pulvere camporum,'’
the duat os tte plain, oorresponds as aeonrately as possible with

weltering “ignoto camporum in pulvere,'' and in the other ease
Somnus flying up to heaven, leaving his vistim tolie naked m
rorone aaran.

Asin our text renova annun is the nand, whose existenoe

indeed was well known, but of whioh nothing more was known ’

to anyone than its mere existen0e3 and as, 11. 865, “ignoto
camporum pulvere '³ is the dnst of the plnina similarly well
known with respect to its existenoe, and similarly unknown
with respeot to all its partioularities3 so, 11.527, ‘⁴ ignota plani.
