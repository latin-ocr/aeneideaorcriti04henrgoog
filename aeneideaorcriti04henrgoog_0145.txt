. guage, or be misled hy my misinterpratation ol this passage in

my “Adversaria Virgiliana‚’' as published in the Gottingan
Philologus. Compare 7. 65, “liquidum trans aethera,'' where
“ aethera'' as little means the ether properly so oalled, aa, the
ether eontradistinguished hom the aer or sky, as narrans in
our text means the olouds properly so oalled, la, the olouds oon·
tradistinguished from the aer or shy. See Remm. on “aethere
in alto,’' 6. 4373 and “nubila'’ 4. 246.

It is in this sense, via, of clear, that liquidus is applied to
water (Aera. 7. 760), to the voioa (Geory. 1. lm), to lire (Eol.
6. 33), to amber (Aea. 8. 402), to honey (Geory. 4. 102), to
augmentation (Quintil. 5, o. ult), ha, and itia probably also
in this its original sense the same word, 'in its English form
liquid (generally meaning flaura), hasbeen applied to the air by
Milton in his Genaua, 97 6 .·

“ to the ooean now I fly,
and those happy elimes that lie
where day naver shuts his eya,
up in the broad holda of the sky3
them I surh the liquid air
all amidst the gardana fair

of Hesperus, and hia daughters three
that sing about the golden tree ;’'

aad to noon by Gray in his Ode to Sprr'ay .-

“ tha insaot youth are on the iring,
anger to tosto the honied spring,
and fleat amid the liquid noon.”

Bad augur as I must aoknowledge myself to be, Ι shall
ventare on an explanation of thio omen, oonoeming whioh
unfortunately servia is wholly silent, and which, variously
interpreted by various commentatore, has yet remainerh as Ι
think, an unsolved enigma down to the present day. Lot
