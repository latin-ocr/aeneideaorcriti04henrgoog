of the magnanimous amazon. If we are iutereeted for Turnus
in the last Book, it is only that that interest, the heaven-sent
miefortunse, final defeat, aud death of the Rutulian prinae may
eet off, exalt, and magnify to the utmost the hero ol the
Aeneia, as the defeat and death of 'Proy's former stay and
hulwark, Hector, sete off, exalte, and magnifiee to the utmoet

. tha hero of the Iliae.

Never, perhaps, wae the unlty of a poem so well pre-
served3 so well preserved alike in the great features and in the
most minute, most trivial particulare. That which it ie the
glory of Slrakespeare to have done so naturally, so anob-
trusively, in a short play, our author bas done no lese naturally,
no lese unobtrusively, during the entire length of a great epia.
Even during the short intervals in which the Hamlet of the
Actaeis is absent from the stage he is still present in the miud’s
eye oi the spectatore. The stage looks lonely without him;
we wonder away from it, and see him wherever he ie. On the
contrary, it isonly in the eleventh canto of the Furinae we are
introduced to Orlaudo. Up to the eleventh canto the drama ie
without a obief actor, without a hero; say, rather, every succee-
sive character who entersis, for the honae, the hero of the
pieoe, strate about for awhile, exite, and makes room for
another to strut about awhile in the same manner, exit, and be
forgotten, until, after an interval, returning, he claime acquaint-
ance with you as an old friend who, after a lapse of time,
eomes accidentally aorose you, and whose features you recognize
not without affort.

In the deep, smooth, majestio stream of the Accae there is,
however, one rough epot3 oue awkward hitah3 ono incon·
venient, inopportune, embarrassing rapid. In the very middle
of the deaieive final struggle, in the very heat and bruut of the
duel between Aeneae aad Turnus, you are suddenly carried
away to heaven, leaving the two heroes, at the close of their
first round, rallied, face to face, aud just ready to begin their
second (12. 789, 790) :

“ hic gladio fidens, hie acer et arduus hesta
assistunt contre certamine Martie anheli.''
