Veron. (Keil’s sd. p. 95, l. 11) :

‘⁴ atque manu magns Romanos impulit smnis.”

Phe reading is no doubt roarwrvos. But who is Portunus,
whether with Martianus (lapella, who (Nupt. 1) makes him oo-
ordinste with Jupiter and Dis (“Neo solum superum regem
testabatur uxorium idque etiam Diti propositum, idque Por·
tuno,” dm, where Grotius interprete Portunus, Neptunus, and
adds: “ etquis neget de Neptuno sensisse Virgilium oum eanite
1u1s sos rnocmnos,'' de), and svensssigns to him the trident
(“Portuni trifidam suspirans flagitat haslam’')-whetherisPor·
' tonus, I say, with Martianus Capella, Neptune himself, or with
Servius (“ Deus marinus qui portubus praeest . . . qui Gnaeos
Palaemon dieitur '') aud the Sohol. ad Palalaps. Verere (“ Por-
tunus, ut Varro dieit, deus portuum portarumque praeses Hune
Grseoi Palaemona vooant”) Palaemon? Ia (larda agrees in
opinion with Martianus (lapella, Voss and lodewig with Ser·
vius, and Heyne vaoillates. For my part I have no doubt at
all that Neptune, denominated Portunus in his oapaoity ol
hurbem-master, is meant 3 first, beorum both oi the rauna msa
and mereo unove, neither of them appropriatsly applied to a
very subordinate divinity3 seoondly, beoause itis likely that
the men Parme who eomes with his grem hand to the help of
Panope and the ohoir of Nereide and Phorous, is not Palaemon,
a god of the same rank with themselves, but their superior and
master, just as the “ipse'' who eomes with his trident to the
help of Cymothoe and Triton is not a god of the same rank es
themselves, but one of muoh mester foros and power, their
master, who sees that his own hand is neeessary3 thirdly,
besam in no mythology is even the greatest god above attend·
ing to minutiae. A greater dod than even Neptune is not
above oounting the haim on a man’s head, and keeping a ehorp
eye on the shooting of sparrows; and indeed, to go from mytho·
logy to philosophy, how is it possible ior great effeots to be
produoed in a world oomisting of atoma, if no attention at allis
paid to the atomel'
