62 sumnus [leo-197 siruamus-uersu

Vel. Flacc. l. 404:

. . . “at prora splendet tua cuspis ab alta,
Aeacide ; tantum baec aliis excelsior hastis,
quantum Peliacas in vertice uicerat omcs.”

Senec. Thyes. 652 .·

“ scd taxus at cupressus, ct nigra ilice
obscura nutat silva, quam supra eminens
despectet alte quercus, et vincat nemus.’'

Το which examples if I add one more, it is not at all because my
argument requires such assistance, but solely because the same
mistake has been made respecting the passage affording the
example as has been made respecting our text itself ; namely, the
vincere oi the passage, while really used in the sense 01 exceed·
ing, excelling, surpassing, doing better than,is assumed to mean
conquering, triumphing. The passage in Silius, 4. 428, where
Jupiter looking down from heaven and seeing young Africanus
hastening te the rescue cf his father, pressed on all sides round
by the enemy, is so pleased with the heroism of the youth asnot
merely to send Mars to his assistance, but in these words place

him frum that moment forward under the immediate tutelage of
Mars :

“ te duce primitias pugnae, te magns magistro
audeat, et primum 100 cipcat, urcacsc parmtcm,''

meaning, not with the commentators: ‘⁶ Haeo prima Scipionis
sit victoria, ut patrem servet '' (Peerlkamp) [ior (a) te bear such,
meaning the words should be not “ primum hoe'’ but hoo pri·
mum, not “servasse ’' but servare; and (b) Mars himself
plainly refers to these words of Jupiter, to greater deeds than
even the saving a father's life, when he says, verse 476 ε “ adhuc
maiora supersunt '’ 1, uus meaning: “efficiat aliquid etiam
maius quam hcc, viu, quam servasse parentem,’' the “aliquid
etiam maius ’³ being the “excidium Carthaginis,’' expleit para·
mount in reserve for the young herc, and loreteld to himin the
most explicit terma by Mars himself in his parting words just
before he leaves for heaven, 4. 472:
