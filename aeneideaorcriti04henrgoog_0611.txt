looee manner in which uun sometimes connecte two unequal or
not perfeotly congruous sentences, as for instance, Aeo. 10. 187:

“ euius olorinae surgunt dc redimendae,
(crimen arnor vostrum) formaeque migne pamm 3‚‚

aud Georq. d. 67:

“ sinautem ad pugnam exieriut-nem saepe dnobus
regibus incessit magno discordia motu-
continuoquo animos vulgi‚” dcc.

Compare Aac. 11. 693, where “ et'' joins the words “ laevo de·
