nonore mrsu, first, because no sufficient reason-I believeImay
say no reason at all—has ever been assigned why those who died
children, or ia limiae lacis, should after their death be placed m
nmina Orci; secondly, because the tmen Orci has been long
passed by Aeneas, even at the other side of the Styx, rr. 273,
279; thirdly, because the “limen’' spoken of by Silius in his
manifest imitationes the Virgilian passage, 13. 547, is the
“limen luois'’ in which the children bad died:

“infantum hinc gregibus, versusque ad limera taedas
passis virginibus, turbaeque ia tanim lucia
Α est iter extinctae, et vagitu ianua nota ; ”
