fair vinds for their onward voyage. So perleot indeed is the
parallelism that it seems, impossible to doubt either that rosca-
nos vnrvros is to be understood as meaning rossanus Anotera
verres or thatVirgil,w1itingthis aooount of the inferiae offered
by Aeneas to Anchises, hed in his mind the irvfmzbe offered by
Pyrrhus to Aehilles, perhaps even this very desoription of them
given in suoh full detail by Euripides.

An example ol the readiness of the anaients (so mnoh resem-
bling our ovvn readiness) to seire every opportunity of usking
favours of their gods, aud espeoially in relation to travelling
(not facilitated at thet time either by rails or steam), will be
found at 4. 57 9, where Aeneas, summarily ordered out of Afrioa
by Meroury, end very unwilling to go—ney, even “exterritus’'
st the meld-propos intervention of divinity-hes presenoe of
mind enough not to‘ let „the god off without at least begging
aliit from him z

“adsis o placidusque iuves, at sidera eaelo
dextro feras.”

text: “ Iat ns try if we oannot kill two birds with one stone,
end not only pay my sire the honours to whioh he is so justly
entitled‚ but at the sometime help ourselves forward on our
journey by getting him, thus flattered and put into good hu·
mour, to give us fair vinds lor our voysgo.'' And very muoh
of thesemo nature is the prayer for a prosperous voyage whioh
Julius (laesor, whilst celebrating infame on the plain of Troy to
the manes of the Trojan heroes fallen in defenoe oi their eonn-
try, takes the opportunity of offering up to the said manes,

“ a· cinerum, Phrygius solitis quicunque minas,
Aeneaeque mei, quos nune Lavinia sedes
servat et Alba Lares, et quorum lueet iu sris
ignis adhue Phrygius, nullique adspecta virorum
Pallas, in abstruso pignus memorabile templo,
gentis Iuleae vestris clarissimus aris
dat pistura nepos, et vos in sede priori
rite voeat; datejclirer in cetera currus.
restituam populos; grata vioe moenia reddent
Ausonidae Phrygibus, Romanaque Pergama surgent.”
