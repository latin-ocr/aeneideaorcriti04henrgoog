unde eieetue fuit hoo ipso tempore. ’ Ergo Evandrus eum
admonuisse videtur, ut mitius regnaret,” Peerlkamp, following
Servius's “hine oontumeliam duait, quod finitimos a tyranni
iniuria non defenderit.'' But Peerlkamp ⁴himself objeets:
“Fatendum tamen Mezentium, nisi aliquid commiserit, quod
propius speetaret Evandrum quam erudelitas eontra Agyllinos,
vix diei posse Euandro iraealtaaae.'' Ι -To he aure, unless Evander
was another Don Quizote, and therefore ohe interpretation
both of Servim and Peerlkamp is erroneous, and not Agylla is
the widowed eity, but Pallanteum. And why not? Was not
Mezentius a tyram, a warrior, and an immediate neighbour?
Waa not Evander weak, and unable to help himself? May we
not safely assume that his stronger, more heflike, neighbour*
was continually enoroaehing on him, and that many ol Euan-J
der's subjeets fell in the repeated nkirmishes, in the horden
variare? Nay, was not Mezentius atthis very moment in the
Rutulian oamp, aad were not the Rutulians and latins always
