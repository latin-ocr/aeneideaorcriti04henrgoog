’ Furtlrer argument, equally independent oi, aud apert from
screa, that it is not Bitias, but Bitiae’e sbs'eld. which ruroms'r
will be found iu Silius's very close imitation, 4. 296:
‘⁶ procumbit lata porrectus in arma ruina, Ι ¹

et pereussa gemit tellus ingentibus armis

haud aliter, stmcto Tyrrhena ad littora saxo

pugnatura fretis subter caecisque procellis

pila, immane seuaue impingitur ardua pontc;

immugit Nereus, divisaque caerula pulsu

illisum accipiunt irata sub aequora mentem‚”
where there is, ou the one hand, no intonare of the second
Bitias, and where there is, on the other hand, the most express
and unmistalrable intonare oi the seooud Bitias's shield; nay,
where Virgil’s imitator, asii ior the very purpose ol rendering
it impossible lor anycne theuoeforwmd ior ever to refer Virgil’s
incure, not to Bitias's shield, butte Bitias himself, has chosen
that term, above all· others, wherewith to describe, not his
second Bitias himself, but his second Bitias's shield:

‘⁴ percussa gemit tillus ingentibus armis.''
