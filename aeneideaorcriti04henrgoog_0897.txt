2. Somnus and Baoohus being both gods alike, sommentators
seem to have thought themselves at liberty to understand our
text oi either· aeeording to their respective fanoies or caprioes.
We are, however, as I think, bound hythe rules of just eriti-
'oism never to interpret any author at random, or, as it were,
by oesting oi lots, or'tmowing of diae, but always, if possible,
to find out a elue to the precise sense intended. On this prin·

eiple, we are 00 the present oeeasiou to inquire what elue the
oontext affords to the 'preoise meaning ol “deus'’ is it possible

to asoertain from it what godin 000110010010000001.ι llx-
amining the passage, we find thet‘ths whole party attaehed are
deseribed as asleep aiter drinking wine. Theyare all sleeping—
one so sound asleep as to be even snoring'lond (roro raornassr
0000000 murum). The god, therefore, who has eonquered

Serranus is not Baeehus, but Somnus. Semanns is, like his oom-
parione, sound asleep, and roro enormem recreas 000000,

and 000000 mensur 00000οΛ uso vmrus are but varied ways ol
saying the same thing ; show in two different persons one and
the same state, under two slightly different aspeots. The sound-
ness both of Senanus’s sleep and ol Rhamnes’s was no doubt
greatly increased hythe depth oi their potatione (vv. 316 and
319); but the essential thing was their being asleep, and
Virgil was too good 0 writer to mark out among a number ol
persons, all sound asleep after a oarouee, 000 10 particular aa
under the espeoial influenoe, not oi sleep, but oi wine. Το
