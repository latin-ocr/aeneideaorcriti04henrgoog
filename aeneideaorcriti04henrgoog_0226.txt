being espeoially ascribed to tha soils in preoisely the same oon-
nexion, 10. 229: “et velis immitte rudentes ; '' with respeot to
the interpretation “ olavum nornm,’' that if suoh were the mean·
ing, the expression would not be chassl mnnrrr asseras, but
anot mnrrnr nannnas3 and with reapaot to the interpreta-
tion ‘⁴ vela,'’ that there is, so far at least as has yet been shown
no example of vela said to be immissa.

If it be alleged, as perhaps it will be alleged, that Ovio,
Fasti, 3. 593:

‘⁶ vincitur ars vento, neo iam moderator Ιιαόοηὶε
utitur, nt rotis,”

applies not indeed the phrase immittere habenas, bnt the'

word “ habenae’' to the teohling of ships, signiiying with that
word either tha rudentes, the vela, the oars, or the reddar,
no matter whioh, then I answer, no; snoh interpretation of the
Ovidian passage isbnt a repetition ol the mistake already
made with respaot to the Virgilian. Ovid's ‘⁴ habenis” is no
lesa figurative, nnsuhstantial, and general than Virgil's naar·
was3 and the sense oi the passage not that the manager ol the
vessel oeases to nse sheets, or oars, or soils, or rndder, bnt that
he oeases to nse reins; asii he had said that the ship's ooaohman
throws down the reins and betakes himself to prayers; and how
little the word “ habenae'' is intended either by Ovid or hy Vir·
gil to be suggestive either of the whole or any partionlar part oi
the ship's taokling is shown by Flor. 2. t: “ Romam elassis
prompte, levis, expedita, et quodam genere oastrensis, ad simili-
tudinem pugnae equest1is‚ sio rema, quasi eatena, agebatur,''
where the oars oi a ship are expressly compared to ‘⁴ habenae ''
understood to mean horses’ rainsss-ia eomparison whioh Florus
had not made, had the word habenae of itself been suggestiva
either oi oars or oi any other part or of the whole ofa ship's
taohling3 and is still further and more plainly shown by
Seneoa’s (Med. dldlz

“ palliat audax Tiphys, et omnes
