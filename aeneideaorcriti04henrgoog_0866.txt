alteration of the taxt, via. the substitutiones one word for
another3 sarran pleosd aiter nur involvas a double alteration

over and above this alteration, a new order oi the words) 3 and

strongly and pathetioslly opposing two things (via the burying
the dead body and ths raising oi a oenotaph) whioh, differing
but littls from eaoh other, munet with propriety bo either
strongly or pathetioally opposed, while on the' other hand
ssnrsrs plaoed in the very position oooupied at' present by
son1rs, and thus beooming oonneotsd, not, bo it observed, with
nannnr nuno, but with sir, serves to plaoe in strong and
pathetio oontrast two things whioh it is proper should ba plooed
in strong and pathetio oontrast, viz. the perishing oi the two
friends together (in ease they both went on tho expedition), and
the surviving of one (if only one went into the danger and the
other did not), whioh surviving one should perform the funeral
ritas of the other, either reoovering his iriend's body and bury·
ing it with the usual honours, or, if his body oould not be
reoovered, raising a oenotnph to him.
