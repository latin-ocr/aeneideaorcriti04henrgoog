put into the mouth ol Mnestheus an exhortaticn to strire· for
victory, so close upon a disclaimer of all hope or thought of
victory, that it was hardly possible the one should not jostle the
other. Unless I greatly mistake, however, Virgil is guilty ol no
such incongruity, end his noc vmcmn not only does not mean
“ haec sit victoria vestra ” or let tta te your triunprd, hut does
mean something essentially different-a something which has
hitherto, so far as I know, entirely escaped the commentatore.
Το find out what this something is, let us take a route different
frum that which the commentatore have tehen, and first inform
ourselves what is the 1100 which Mnestheus calls upon his com·
rades “vincere'’ We ere told it is “non ultimos redire '' (“In
hoo cernatur victoria vestre, utne extremi redeamus,'' Wagner
(1861) ; “Let this triumph be yours, not to have heen last,'’
Conington), and herein consiste the primary, the fundamental
error of the commentatore—Mnestheus's immediately preceding
words [it is only to immediately preceding or immediately fol-
lowing words hoc ever refers, compare in the preceding verse:
sursaswr eureus soc, namura, nanum, where rice is supe·

rare3 and Hor. sat. 1. 3. 115:
“ nec vincet ratio tce, tantumdem ut peccet idemquc,'‘

where “ hoc '‘ is “tantumdem nt peccet idemque ’Ἰ conseming
not not returning lost, bnt returning leat, nxrnsuoe recussa.
Eumenes runnar sanuses, says Mnestheus, and then immedi-
ately adds noc vmcrra, i. a, vmcrrn nxraauos nnorrsss, excel,
sterpeta, ccceed retortisy lost, i. e, do better stan return loct. Not
one word ef victory, or triumph ; nothing but a passionate ex·
hortation to do better then return last. “ Be ashamed,'’ he says,
“of returning laet3 do better than that, be not guilty cf that
neres, that sin.’' For vincere in thie sense of to eccecd, sur·
pass, excel, dc better ttae, compare Ovid, Met. t. 178.-
