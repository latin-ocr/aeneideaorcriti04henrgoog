Because the Scor-god only wants Ausonius to notice him, nol
et all to come to him and hide himself iu liis bosom. Except
thet they are both modswith the outer garmeni, there is no re·
semblence between the two signols—-no resemblance either in
manner or purpose: the slight resemblance, vie, chat thoy ere
both mede ‘⁶ tcto veste,'’ rests entirely on e disputed reading of
the Ausoniae text. The rivel reading “torta'’ affording the
sense: vaith hia parerent vencec le the cir, affords e clearer picture,
end, I doubt not, is the true reading.

But there is e passage of Ausonius which is perfeotly parel-
lel to, end ufforde the aptest illustration ol, our text. ·It is
thal in which the poet (Macell. 418) commende the libiae-god
to open the “ caeruleae sinuses'' oi his “ peplnm‚” and make
room within them for the fraternal weters of the Moselle (the
wetere of the Moselle running into the Rhine, at (lobleua):

“ caeruleos nunc, Rhene, sinos hyaloque virentem
pande peplum, spatiumque novi metere fluenti,
fraternis cumulandus equis‚”
e true parallel in which we have, not, es in the pseudo-parallel
ol the commentatore, c mere noticing or calling of the attention ⁴
with the flourish oi a germont in the eir, but e wide-throwiug·
open oi the germont itseli lor the receptiou ot' a brother, who,
cominges his own accord, requires uo invitation, no vooauruu,
end for whom, not being e fugitive, there ‚need not be, sud

therefore ere not, any ‘⁶ latebrae'’ either invited to or provided.
Compare Vel. Flace. 2. 34:

“ iamque Hyperionius metae meris urguet Hiberi
currus, et evictae prono hrenrur habenae
aethere, cum polmus Tethys grandaeva ciuesque
sustulit, et rupto sonuit sacer aequore 'l'item‘'

Vesve.- T le celer porracei ; the “ peplum ’' of the Ausonian
parallel, the “ carbasus’' of the 'liber-god, vs. 33, chove:

. . . “eum tenuisglauoo velebetamietu
ercams'

Vectio, so ier es I know, is always the celer drea, no mutter ot
what form, es Plant. capt. Prol. 37:

“ itaque inter se commutant reah-m et nomino β’
