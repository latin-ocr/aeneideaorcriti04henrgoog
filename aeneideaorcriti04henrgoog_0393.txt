'370 lapsuras [eae-eso com-meson

When I was travelling in Germany, in 1849, Ihappened to pass
the night in e little inn near the town of Tabor, in Bohemia,
where the landlord amused his company with pleying the either.
It was not our gnitar, buta mnoh smaller instrument, about the
sine of a small fiddle. It was laid on its baele on the tsble so
that the stringe (from twelve to fifteen ia number) were upwnrds
and horisontal. The landlord played it without holding it, only⁷
patting the ohorde with his fingere. On the thumb of his right
hand he wore a braas ring (see plan below), to whioh was attached
a thin plate ol elestie steel BF. Ooeaeionally he pulled the
ohords with the point, F, ol this tangue or plato oistee13 and
whenever hadid so the sound ofthe string beeame louder and
olearer. The shape oi this steel tongne or plato, whioh is exaetly
that of the tooth of e oomh, may be the reason why the instru-

ment wae ealled “pentem'' or perhaps anoiently there were
more tongues used than one, so that the similitude to a oomb
may have been still greater.

Hm annos aserenon nascar, rnncnnnmraa rnonss (rs. 648).
-Thet the struature ie onnes ennom, not raonns annoni, is
shown less by the point placed atterendam in the Medioean

(see Prelaoe for observatione on the punctuation of thet Me, and
Rem. on 6. 395) than by the parallel (verse 5803:

“ hie genus antiquum Terrae, Titania pubes,”

and the ‘⁴ genus alto a sanguine Tenori '' of verse 500, and the
“ veteris generosam sanguine Teneri'’ of Ovid, Met. It. 698.
Isos assaaneoseos (vs. thol—Why are only two of the
sons of Tros seen by Aeneae end not the third? The msweris
easy3 beeaum the third is in heaven, penning out neotar for the
gods. Aeneae will not see Ganymede till aiter he is himself

translated.
