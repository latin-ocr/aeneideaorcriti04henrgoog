Ribbeolr has plaoed the first 11 these lines within braokets, and
observes in a note: “Versum 716, quem non interpretatur Ser·
vius, poeta primo eonomine in sohedas effusum postea in eius
vioem v. 717 elaborato omitti voluerat, sed relietum in textu
delere religioni habuerunt amioi.’' And 7111 friends performed
a very friendly part not only towards Virgil, but towards the
sense-the sense requiring the former line soaroely 1111711111 7111
latter, inasmueh as without the former line 711111 is no 1111 and

' 111 1111111111 consa, both essential to 7111 1111 expression 11

Α111111111’ meaning, whieh is not that he had been a long time
desirous to enumerate his offspring, but that he had been 1 long
time desiroua 71 enumerate his offspringto 111 aon Aeaeae (mar) 3
and not merely to enumerate them 71 him, but, as olearly
appears 111111 every line 11 the sequel, to 1111 them to tim ia
persea (1111111111111111), The two lines 111 mutually de·
pendent, eaeh 11711111, aeoording 71 the author's usual habit,
supplying something whioh is wanting in the other, and both
together making up a sense whioh it was impossible, without 1
eonsentration wholly foreign 717111 author's manner, to express
within narrowsr limita. There isa similar division 11 7111111111
subject-matter into two mutually dependent passages or alausas
a little abore, where we are informed, ww. 680, 681, that
Anehises “lustrabat inclusas animas superumque nd lumen
ituras‚'' and, werse 682, that he “recensebat numerum aaronque
nepotes.'’ Is it not plain that the “reeensebat'' there repeats
“lustrabat’' exaotly as in our text unumunurn repeats 111111-
1111 and 1111111111 111111 and that “omnem suorum numerum
carosque nepotes’' there repeats “inclusas animas superumque
ad lumen ituras‚” exaotly as in our text 1111111 rixosum re·
peats 1111, those identieal “inolusas animas superumque ad

lumen ituras ''? And is it not equally plain that as verse 683
