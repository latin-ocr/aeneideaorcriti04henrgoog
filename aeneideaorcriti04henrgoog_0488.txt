nurse be exalted at the expense ol Hesperia? Is it beoause the
family of the reigning dynasty must be everythirrg, and the

Wagner answers that the words are not depreeiatory but ex-
altiog: “ nr erolus, quae seilieet est amplissima,'’ aud quotes
Osiri, Fasti, 6. 27 .· “ est aliquid nupsisse Iovi.’' My auswer is

rites, of sueh poet-mortem observanees‚ gifts, and memoriale.
Ne doubt it did, and the words are in contradiotien with aneient
religione faith3 but nature is stronger than luith, aud Virgil had
