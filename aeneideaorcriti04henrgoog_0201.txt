Peerlkamp-en ingenious solution, as Peerlkamp’s solutions
so often are, but as is equally true ol so many ol Peerlkamp’s
solutions not needed. Re ponere means not alone to put book
a removed thing into the plaoe whieh it formerly oooupied, as
1. 257: “sio nos in seeptra reponte?” but also to restore a
damaged, used, or nom-ont thing to its former offioe or effi-
oieney, as Tacit. Ausul. 1. 63: “Gaeoinoe dubitanti quonam
modo ruptos vetustate pontes moneret . . . eastra metari in loeo
plaauit,'' not surely put boot rte old broken-down brtdpee toto their
plures (not haring been removed they oould not be put book),
but mola them good, restore them to their use ancl ffcieuoy ; and
so in our text, restore tho dolf-roneumed ts’mbero. How the res-
toration was to be effeoted, whether by mere reparation of the
old, or substitution of nen, is not explained either by Vmgil in
the ease ottho ships, or by Taoitns in the osse oi the bridges3
but in the ease of the ships, ut leest, itis probable that mere
reparation is meunt, nouom signifying the strong beams ol the
ship, and these beams being on the one hand only purtially
burned, and on the other being oontrasted with the rnorem,
whioh were ol small eomparatire magnitude, end are deseribed
as being made entirely new (novumn).
