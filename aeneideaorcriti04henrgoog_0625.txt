brushwood with their ieet, had been no picture at all, at least
no picture with which Catillus and Geras, rushing into the
midst oi the enemy, could with propriety heve* been compared,
Catillus end Coras being full in view under the open sky, the
Centaure 'hid from all view by the tell trees.

The “ silvas'' of Statius's imitation, Theb. d. 139.-

“ non aliter siloas humeris, at utroque refringens
pectore, montano duplex Hyleus ab sntro
praecipitat, pavet Ossa vias, pecudesque feraeque
procubuere metu,”

is oi course to be understood in the same way as the srnvs
and mucosus oi our text, for Statius, Rodomont es he was,
was hardly Rodomont enough to break down lull-grown trees
with the mere impetus of a Gentaur coming down from a
mountain ; also the υληυ oi Hom. Il. 12. Iit:

πρυμνην εκταμνοντυ,

for who ever yet heard of, or aven imagined, wild boare rushing

'th euch violence as to overturn tell full-grown trees? That
Donatus es little peroeived as his brother commentatore the rael
oonstnrction oi the passage, es little imagined as thoy that the
letter clause oi the sentence was the mere explanatory vanation
of the first, appears plainly from his gloss, “ his currentibus
cedunt omnia, quae fortassis occurrerent,'’ the “omnia'' oi which
is neither more nor less then an equivalent ior both the great
trees and the underwood3 and it isno doubt to the samaI
must say, gross misoonoeption oi our author’s meaning we ere
indebted for Ariosto’s very absurd and ridiculous picture of
Bajardo breaking down and bearing before him not only trees,

but eserything which opposes his passage through the wood,
Orc. bier. 1. 72 .·
