Heyne’s defense of Camilla’s skimming along the tops of the
ears of oorn without hurting them, and over the tope of the waves
without wetting her feet: “ velooitatis denotationem, v. 808 sqq.
temere reprehendunt viri dooti. Neo illa utique eonvenit nos·
tris sensibus ; sed, oum Maro ea uteretur, a vetustate quasi per

manus erat tradita3 expressit enim, ΙΙ. 20. 886-889 de equabus

is a wouh defenoa The defense should have been not that Vir· ,
gil followed the bad example of Homer, but that Virgil's exag-
geration, gest as it is, is soaroely half as great as Homer's, the
speed of Camilla, represented by the uenditionals vonaunr and
ranunr luae (might or oouhlflp and might or could traval), being
only iopoeae, while the speed of Erichthonius’s mares represented
by the indioatives θεον and θεεσκον (did ran), is in essa. To whioh
better defenoe, Heyne, had he only suffioiently understood his
author, might bave added the further defenoe that not even in
porrois Camilla’s swiftness that whioh it has been generally and
even by himself represented to be, via, that of dying along the
tops of the oorn without touohing them, but only that of flying
along them without injuring them (see above).
