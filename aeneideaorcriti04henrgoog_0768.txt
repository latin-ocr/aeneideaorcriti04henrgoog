back again to earth? No; no; Virgil ie guilty oi no such
absurdities. It is a mere and total mistalrc oi the author's
meaning. The descriptionis notos the carrying of the arms
through the air, either to Aeneas or to Olympus, but of a sign*
or prodigy reminding Aeneas oi Venus’s promise to bring the'
errns, a pledge that the arms would surely be brought, vs. 523:

m SIGNUM cinno cirrium ministrer Armeno

vs. 534:

light, orashing noise, trumpets braying, arms seen clashing and

heard olanging in the sky 1 Compare Tibull. 2. 5. 71 :

“ hae iore dixerunt belli mala signa cometen,
multus utin terras deplueretque lapis :

Ovid, Met. 15. 783 .-

“ erma ferunt nigras'inter crepitantia nrrbes,
