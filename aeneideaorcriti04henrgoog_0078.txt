“ tum celsos ourru Mavors ‘ oartlaqtaia arcer
natumst inquit, ‘Tyriosque ad foedera eoges;
nulla tamen longo tanta exorietur in aevo
lux tibi, oare puer, et adhue maiora supersunt,
sod nequeunt meliora dari! Tum nubila Mavors
aetheraque, emenso terras iam sole, capessit.'’

Ii thisbe, asI think it is, the true construction and meaning
of the passage, we have not only Mnestheus’s noc vrncruu,
c1vss, in the most perfeet hannony with Mnestheus’s

to Mnestheus, and insist on keeping our “ bonus Virgilius ’'
always to his triunps, we shall bo in imminent danger when we
oome to 12. 684, if we ever oome so far, of imagining that the

pioture there set before us is that of a mountain so desperately
wioked es to break off and tumble down from its own top:

“ ao veluti montis saxum de vertice praeoeps

proluit, aut annis solvit sublapsa vetustam
