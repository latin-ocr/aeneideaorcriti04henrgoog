Avrs.·-Donbtless = maioribus.

Maunr, in preferenoe to tenet, the sense ol naunr being
strong, while that ol tenet (seiz. lor obtinet) is wealu, is more
proper for a grammatieal fop than a great poet.

[Aliter] Heyne reads annea nnoanau, and explains:
“ Urbs olim diota a maioribus, avie, runnu nsunr ea urbs
etiamnum uranon uonna ;'’ an explanation not to be admitted
il it were only beoauee ouonnanr signifiee that tha plaoe was no ,

present day, ol Ardea, the same oity of Ardea, with the same
famous name—how, Ι am alred, do I reoonoile this remaining,
this Manen with the ohnnge implied by ouounanrl' Nothing
sanior, and this ispreoisely the point, the point whioh, as I think,
both Heyne and La Cerdo and all oommentators have missod.
Annus is not the neme but an epithet of the oity, noces Annua
auonnsn morus ms. Ardea in old times had the epithet
annno, it was “ annus Ardea,” “ Ardea annna,’' on aooount ol
