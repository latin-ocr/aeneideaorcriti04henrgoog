and forwerda, hither and thither, but that the gyrations ol one
set ol turma impeded, obstrueted the gyratione el the other set
ol turma, that the turms obstrueted eaeh other in their gyrations3
and so sisar emuniens raanan. That thie meaning, via, that

ol obstruotion, is contained in meantum* seems placed beyond
doubt by the immediate subjunction of the word rueras to ru·
ranmur in this plaoe, and oi both russam andraeas to ms·
rnnrunr at vs. 5943 also hy the nse whieh eur author makes ol
the same word elsewhere, as 9. 384:

“ Euryalum tenebrae ramorum onerosaque praeda
impediunt”

(where the notion ol eneumbering, impeding‚ embarrassing, is
evident); 8. 448:

. . . “septenosque orbibus orbes
impsdtuat’'

[eomplieate seven orbs with more orbs, eo as te eneumber the
shield, make it diffieult to be used]. In these two just quoted
passages, as well as in our text and at vs. 593, “ impediunt'' has
not only the same general sense of enoumbering, impeding with

viz, at the end ol its own sentenoe, and at the beginning of a
new line, the pause immediately following it rendering it em·

from the term “ orbes” applied (ati supro) to the turns invarious
direetions made by Turnus, and explained, vs. 753, by the
‘⁶ mille vias '’ in whioh the hunted deer “fugit refugitque,'' just
aa the oseas made by Ascanius's turmae are explained by the
“ mille viae” ol the Cretan Labyrinth‚ and the sporting together
of the delphine. On the ether hand, soldiere when fighting
sometimes formed themselves into an orb or round body. See
Liv. 4. 39 (ed. Wallrer); 28. 22, 333 and 4. 28 ; Sall. Juyorttu,
97. 5 “orbes fecere.’'
