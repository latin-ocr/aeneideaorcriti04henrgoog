“ iste quidem Argolicis hand olim indebitus armis
luetur adut. reolo descendunt limite Psrrse.''

Ils'd. 5. 471 (Hypsipyle, oi J ason) ε

“ inde fugam Minyae, sociosque appellet Isson
efferus, ο utinam ism tum mes littora rectis
praeterveetus φάθ’

(where “praeterveetus aquis reotis'' is carried poet Lemnos and
¹ etrurplrtforward or orruorrl ly tle wetere). Ovid, ea Ponto, 6. 9.·

“ eum poteram recto transire Cersnnia relo”

(where “ reete velo''is spat before the wind, and consequently
‘⁶ rento limite'’). The same thought is sometimes expressed by

the term rectus applied direetly to the ship itseli, as Ovid,
Rern. Am. 70 .· ’

“ reeteque eurn sociis, me dirce, naris eat.’'

The reading murra is to be preferred to aureus, first ba
oause it affords s better sense, there being no resson why Virgil
should so insist upon the preeise oonrse taken hythe fleetto
Caieta, viz, thet it wss along the shore, and every resson why
here at the last verse but one oi the Book he should despsteh
his ohsrge nith the words werel straight, without more ado, to
Ouielo; sud seoondly, because not only does the wordnrnnons
ooour in the sslf-same position in the very next verse, the lest
verse oi the Book, but the word ‘⁶ Ettoribus'' meets us third word
in the next Book. The reading nrrrosn whioh has found so
great favour both with oopyists snd editors seems to me to have
srisen from a eonfusion ol this verse with the nent, just as the
“ magnum deinde'’ of the Roman MS. at verse 814 arose, not,
ss suggested by Ribbeck, from s oonfusion with the Elepr'o ad
Messallam, but, very obviously and naturally, hum aeonfnsion

wilh the line next hut one preoeding3 in whioh both those
words ooeur.

END OF BOOK vl.
