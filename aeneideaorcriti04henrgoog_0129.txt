are mere ekes, very neeessary indeed to the sound, but adding
nothing to the sense3 exaotly aa Oowper, John Gilpia :

“ so, ‘fair and softly‚' John ho eried;
but J ohn le cried in vain‚”

where I own I ean no more pereeive how either of the two “he'' ’s
serves to make us feel that that ludierous personality (John Gril-
pin) is impressing itself upon the horse, than I ean peroeive how
the man of our text serves to make us “feel that that tremen-
dous personality [Entellus] is impressing itself upon Dares.'’
ΜΓ. Conington's opinion, however, is neither new nor singu-
lar, a similar opinion having been expressed hy several oommen·

tatere before his time, and notably by Olarke adflom.11.3.t09,

quoted above: “vox ογε nequaquam hio supervacanea est, sed
elegantissimam tum in Graeeo tum in Latino sermone emphasin

habet, quom linguae recentiores prorsus ignorant,'’ hy whom
not only our text, and Hor. oa 1. 9.15, Seneo. Here. Far. 1248,
quoted tbove, but the following examples also have been adduoed
in support of the doetrine, Od. t. 325:

η naha Τηλεμαχος φονον ημιν μερμηριζει.
η τινας εκ [ivnon αξιι warram ημαθοεήος,
η ογ( και Σπαρτηθιν, ms νυ περ seras arras·

Hesiod‚ Opera et Dies, 246:

ητωνγε στρατον ενρυν exoneret, η ογε ταχος,

in not one of which am Ι able to deteot anything in the inter·
eolation exeept an awkward help to the measure, a pronoun
thrust in where the sense does not require it', hardly even permits
it. Further proof, if further proof be desired, that the sense of
our textis preeisely the same as it would have been had the mna
been inserted after sorr, will be found in Ovid, Met. t. 308 .·

“ neo inordum sumit, 11⁸0 Pi⁰f⁸⁸ ‘'²²“ Phffim’„

where the sense is preoisely the same as it would have been had
the “illa'' been inserted after “ sumit.”
