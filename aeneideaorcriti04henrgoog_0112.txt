aliquem in eursu relinquit est prior? and by sueh observation
exhibiting on the ona hand his perception, however inadequate,
oi the absurdity of the received meaning oi the passage, and on

the other hand hie total ignoranoe of the unanimous reading oi ⁴

the MSS„ a reading whioh not only does not involve an absur-
dity, but actually presente the desiderated sense: that had the
reae-mursa been longer, Diores would have slipped past and
distanoed Helymus. “Ana1anvnvn,'' Thiel, observing: “ Bei
entfernterm aial kima er vor oder maehte unsntsohieden‚ wer
eigentlieh gesiegt.'' “Analononva‚'' Gossraa observing τ “Ita-
que silongior oursvrs supererit, faoila poterit aemulum vinoere
ant oorta aequare.’' “ Anarooonvn,’' sapho, making no obser·
vation at all, nor any inquiry about either MS. or reading. ⁵

Tha seeond olanse oi the Virgilian passage is not, with these A

editors and commentatore, an alternative oi tha first, but, whioh
is muoh moro affimant, rhetorical, and poetis, as well as much

more in our author's usual manner, a elimam, steinthorp, or
epexegesim and the Homeris parallel is not Il. tl. 382 .·

και νυ κεν η παρελασσ’, η apparemus εθηκυ,

butll. 93. 526-7ῐ

ει δε κ’ «τι προτερον 'ysam δρομοε supersparsa,

τω w μιν παρελασί, ουδ’ αμφηριστον stater,
where we have not only tha similar apodosis but tha similar pro-
tasis, and evan'the similar elimax, sternatur, or epexegesis. ‚An-
mavum is thus the desoriptive predicata so often (I may almost
say always where possible) used by virgil instead oi ths per·
sonal pronoun: the latter hali of the line is, as the latter hali of
Virgil’s line so often is, a elimax of the previous halt, and tha
distinotion is observed (as by Stat. Theb. 6. 712:

. . . “neodubia iemawoMnesthoa‘viotum
wamatiit meta ; leaqe super aemula signa
consedit”)

between passing-by and quite distanoing and leaving behind.
Compare Georq. l. Ill:

“ rernm haee ipse equidem spatiis anolinus iniquis
mutereo, atque aliis post me memoranda relinquo,''

unsar, emanas, von 111. l
