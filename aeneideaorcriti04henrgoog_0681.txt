Ruuonn susanna—In separating these words from canantur,
and throwing them to nanrrun, Heyne has performed the part
of a true aritio-first, beeanse they harmoniae badly aa part
ol tho oonseqnenoe of the smoothness of the water3 in other
words, man rncnrruu caraman the logioal consequence of
the smoothness ol the water, but tran 'racarruu cannam
nuuoan susunno is illogical, does not follow as a consequenoe
at all. Seoondly, because they not only harmoniae well with
unauna onera ‘vauls asma, but are neeessary to take away, to
olothe with hair as one might say, the baldnesa of the expression
nastros usura vante naras. Thirdly, beoause “labitur'' is
similarly eked out, 10. 687:

’ “ labitur alta wenna fluctuque aestuque seeundo.”

Fourthly, beonnae “rumore'' is actually joined with “interlabi’'
by Ausonius, Mosell. tt

† “ interlabentis tacito rumorelloadhnl‘

Fifthly, beoauae separated from annona ancarano, the sentenoe
naso tran racarnuu cnunnanr not only strongly resembles in
east “ergo iussa parat,'’ 4. 503, but lias an exaot parallel in
ff-nay, seerns to, be a repetition ol “ ergo iter inoeptum pera·
gunt,’' 6. 384.. Wagner, andoing aa usual the work ,of Heyne,
maturas (en Heyn.) tha two words to catananr, . and to make
them as easy ae he oan in tho bad eompany, understands them
to signily the celeusma! In his etl. oi 1861 he reuounoes the
interpretation, but still insisto en forbiddlng the banus between
the parties Heyue had pointed out as made for eaoh other.
