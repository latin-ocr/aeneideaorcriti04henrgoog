gyrio oi Aeneas. 'l'o him take your presente, says Diomede; 1
with him make your pesoe as fust as you oan3 I oan tall
(experto oredite) how strong his arm; with what a whirl he
flings his spear3 it was his resistanoe and Heotor’s whioh spun
out the war oi Troy to ten years3 had there been but two mors

Aenenses in the oity, the united ioroo of Greeoe had never
triumphed over it; nay, the tables hed been turned, and Argos,

net Troy, laid iu ashes-but that war a bounos. In the debnte
oi the Latius ou the reply it is still Aeneas, Aeneas alone who ⁶
is prominent both before us and the debaters. The whole
question between the invaded and their invaders is to be re·
sulved by single oombst oi the ohiei aggressor with the ehief
aggressed3 after all, perhaps, as equitable a deoision oi disputo
as the ingenuity of mankind has ever yet invented; brieter, st

least, and no less trenohant than any of onr modern decisione,
whether by oourt oi law, with its appeals and sesentiens, or by

high oourt oi parliament‚ er by low oomt oi universal snffrnge,
the majority in every osse deoiding, and the majority being, in
its very nature, in every ease tha major foros—in single nombat
the major forae of a single uplifted arm3 in a legal, or eonsti-
tutioual judgment, the major foros of a thousand right arms,
only not uplilted‚ because submitted to and oowered beneoth.
'l'he remorsa of Latinus, the confusion and embarrassment ef
lavinia,

“ eausa mali tenti, oeulos deieeu decoros ;”

the prayer of the women in the temple of Pallas,

‘⁶ frange manu telum Phrygii praedonis et ipsum
pronum sterne solo portisque effunde sub nltis,'‘

all keep Aeneas bodily before your eyes. If it is neeessary
that Aeneas and Camilla should not oome into oollision3thst
the devoted heroine should not simply suooumb to the superior
loros oi the hero, but Maon perhaps its most exquisite oharm
ou the romanoe by perishing, like Blanohe of Devan, by a

eowardly arrow. Aeneas’s having the open plain, and sur·
prising the oity by s short forced moreh through the mountains,

affords sn opportunity ior tho exploits slike end sad catastrophe
