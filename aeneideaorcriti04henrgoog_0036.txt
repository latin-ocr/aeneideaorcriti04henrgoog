stt-60 nmo-nicasia] BOOK Υ. 21

Quint, Deel. 323: “ deos immortales omnes quidem, praecipue
tamen numen et mihi maxime familiare. . . invaso . . . ut . . .
relat impunitum asae saaerdotis offioium,'’ and elsewhere, “ velit ’'
isequivalent to moy he pleraed, plesse, orant.

Aliter. Poscsuus usuros.-“ Fastis inferiis daos rossanus
usuros seaundos,” Heyne, Wagner. I think not, for, as re·
marked by Heyne himself, “Habent venti aliquid aloao alie·
num, nam Anchisae frunt inferiae, non saara diis seeundas
navigationi expetendae.'' Hsyne, having arrived so far, should
have gone a step further, and rejecting his interpretation, “ fastis
inferiis deos rossanus russos seeundos‚'’ have separated the ia·
feriae from the rososuus sanuses, via, by plaaing these latter
words in a parenthesis (see Reman 6. 84) thus ε “ Let us inati-
tute a festival here in honour of Anahr'ses, to he repeated annually
in our new aountry ’⁹ ; the thought being interrupted in the mid-
dle (see Rem. on 6. 743) in order to answer the objeation, “ will
you thus delay us on our journey for the long time neeessary
to establish a festival, and prepare for and perform gamos Ρ ''-
an objection whiah is answered in the words rossanus vanius:
“ we must weit whether or n0, for the winda are eontrary.'' The
sommentators were misled hythe frequent use of posuere in
eonjunotion with deos to assume that it was used similarly
here, and that the “ venti'' were to he hegged of Anahises as of
a god; but (1) posuere is not always used so, does not always
mean hawise, aaliuy, or derrmndiap somethr‘ny qt'arretter person,
but, on the contrary, quite as frequently means sees-aq to obtata
sor· one's sels by arry triesas, as 11. 453: “arma manu trepidi
posaunt;'' ll. 901 : '⁴‘ et saeva Iovia sie numina posaunt;'' 5.
707; “quae fatorum poseeret ord0;’' and so the parenthetia
manus sauros, let aa aeek to obtain rrr'mlr, viz, by waiting for
them; in other words, utile sce are waiting J'ora etorrye osrciad ;
and (2) if rossanus does indeed require a person to be supposed
of whom the winda ars to he sought, that person need not be
Aretissa but may es well and even better he Jupiter, or some
other god.
