magnified by uoan, and the great magnitude ol the Chimaera,
expressed by rnoaunau and magnified by nona, is magnified
again by insnum. I cannot agree, cannot permade myself,

that in a great ressel actually under weigh-

there was something mom to be described as striking the eye at
first sight than its mere magnitude, however great that magni·

tude might be; that the way it was making, the molimen, the
affort, the momentum with which it moved‚ raised the admira·
tion of the beholder no less than its magnitude, and should no
less thau ite magnitude enter into its description by the poet.

ship at sea, via, its majestic movement, bearing, or oarriage, but
having in rnoawrnu (Lueretius'e “ magnam'’) expressed the ma·
jestic sire of his Chimaera (Lueretius’s “magnam navem’'), has
in tunsum uonn (Lucretius's “ magno molimine’') expressed the
majestic motion, the great sway, impulse, momentum, “impete’l

“ eut hominem tanto membrorum esse impote natum,

trans maria alta pedum nixus ut paudere posset,
