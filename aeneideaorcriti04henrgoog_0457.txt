ἱ 434 AENEIDEA [aaa-846 roera-rnen

Ancn 1101101101 (vs.831).-SoArnmian. 15. 10: “Monoeci
oroom et portum ad perennem sui memoriam oonseoravit [Her-
oules].” Monoeous‚ the modern Monaoo, being at the very 1001
01 the mountain, and on the very level 01 the sea, the “ arx
monerer ” must have been alort or 000110 011 the side oi the
mountain overhanging the town Monoecus, and probably in the
situation 01 the medem Turbia, where I and my daughter slept
on the night 01 Tuesday‚ J an. 15, 1861, and where they show
Roman ruins. ⁴

Sannum unus (vs. 836).—Mnus, not erus, is most undoubt

edly the true reading. Anohises addresses Julius Caesar as his
blood, 1. 0., his otispring, Julius Caesar being the deseendant 01
Aeneas the son 01 Anehisee. Reading unus (lor whioh reading
alone there is, so far as Ι know, any Me. authority), we have
not only the parente] tendernees 01 the speaker, butue have
the genealogy 01 000001 and the house 01110 Gaesars, on both
sides, vin, both on mother'a aud father's side: on the mother's
side in eunus aur noers onnnr03 on the iather’s in 00110010
nnus: further, we have this genealogy on both sides divine,
Anohises himself being desoended from Jupiter through Dar·
danus: further still, we have the identioal double genealogy

whioh Horaoe has in so similar terme assigned to Augmtus,
Coros. Sooool. 50:

“ olarus Anchisae Venerisque sanguis ; ’⁹

and lastly, we have in 00110010 uenus an expression not only
used in the same sense and manner by other Latin writers (as

stae. seeo. 3. 239 :

. . . “vos,osuperi‚ 01000 ordine sanquis,
nepugnate odiis,''

a very plain imitation 01 00110111, and showing that the reading
in Statius's time was not erus but nnus), but one whioh‚ derived

from the Greek (compare Hom. Od. 16. 300 .·

11 mor γ’ apos εσσι και ueneror 000110ρο10.

Id. 11. 6. 011,-

· norm τοι yonam τε και αι ματος ενχομαι earm).
