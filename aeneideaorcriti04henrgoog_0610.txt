Compare Apollon. Rhod. l. 689 :

“Securitas omnis inpromptu est,'' Servius* (cod. Dresd. Daniel,
Lien), followed by Rnhkopf (“ omne auxilium mihi aute pedes
et paratum est seni’'), Wagner (1861), Forbiger and Thiel-au
explanation to which there is the very obvious objeotion that in
linrine is never “ ante pedes et paratum, but always in principio,
Germ. cnfanpa On the other hand, Heyne’s interpretation “et
totus sum in aditu portus, in portu navigo‚'' although all right aa
far as1n murra is conoemed, is scarcely less objectionable; first,
beonnae curus (opo) cannot well stand without anna ; and secondly,
beccum nonnus, simply and by inan, is wholly inadequate to
express the port of death. Only when he hae read the words
runnnu rumor eronroa can the reader be quite sure that the
port at whose entrance Latinus has arrived is the port of death.
Compare Cic. ad Ram. 1. 15: “Sed nescio quomodo ipsae illae
excludere me aperta ct paybpio ridentur,'' et quasi exprobrare
quod in cu cito maneum, in qua nihil insit, nisi propagatio miser-
rimi temporis,” where it is impossible ior the reader certainly
to lmow what “ portus’' and “ perfugium ''is meant, until he
arrives at the explanation contained in the words “ quod in ea
vita maneam.'’ I therefore throw onnus to srouron, and under·

“Au error iu the printed text of most editions of Servius, via, “in portu est,” ³
instead oi “in promptu eat,” baa led most of the elder, aud some even of the lator
commentators, into a fatal, and to those oi their madere who are unaware oi the
error, wholly unaccountable confusion. Only to those who aro auare of the error
in the Serwiau text, are Taubmaun'a “ Mihi mortis vicinae beneficio quies ot sccu-
